This product is incredible! It works perfectly and I would recommend it to anyone.,0
"I bought this phone for my daughter and she said that she loves it. The phone arrived in what seemed to be perfect condition. The sim card slot is a regular size and not micro, which is exactly what I needed. Otherwise, I would have had to buy a micro sim kit. I am very happy with my purchase.",0
I love my phone! I have taken it all over the world and it has work in every country that I went to and the pictures it takes are WOW.,1
"The mobile is Ok but in the description said that it is able to work with 4G, that is wrong. I'll kindly suggest to delete this point form the page description",1
"
I had to return because it was not compatible with Tracfone. The phone was in great condition, but I had to unfortunately return it.",0
The box is very simple and the charger is not a cube like apple.,0
This device has issues with charging once the battery is completely drained.,0
"Positive: The wide array of apps. The speed. The sound. The camera.
Negative: The short life of the battery.",0
Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk in the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you.,1
"Exceeded my expectations. This is now my traveling phone, camera, and video recorder all wrapped up in one. Beautifully built quality product that is quietly elegant in appearance. The Windows Phone operating system works great with all of the Microsoft office tools. I am very happy with this purchase.",1
The phone is in great condition and it works perfectly fine,1
Defective product (camera not work)Disappointed not recommend,1
I bought this phone for my mom. She wanted a simple ring and answer phone. This did the trick. The buttons are big and very visible. I really like this phone.,0
"The screen had light coming through the blacked-out areas, and the volume buttons were not flush with the rest of the phone.",0
"This seller is a total rip-off. They sold me an old, re-built iPhone that was pieced together from different components. The serial number had been changed, so Apple wouldn't honor the warranty. I had to buy a new iPhone from them. Don't buy from Ross Cellular!",0
I have had this product for a while and have not had any issues. It functions as it should.,0
"If you have not enough time to charge your phone, this phone is the beast choice for you",1
" Out of the five unlocked phones that I purchased, only four of them were actually unlocked.",0
Awesome cell phone! Everything wroks perfect and its design is beautiful.,1
"Received today. Title says unlocked, tag on phone says Verizon, will update following visit to obtain proper SIM card.",1
I love my new phone and use it constantly! Thank you for the phone.,0
"Over all a great phone, camera is amazing! Too bad Microsoft had to mess with Nokia Maps . In walk mode, my old Pureview 808 had voice guidance, which is lacking. Also, we don't all want to store things up in cyber space, not able to sotre and transfer using my pc. Hopefully, Microsoft will take care of both these issues which are my main complaints.",1
I thought I was going to receive an UNLOCKED cell phone. It appears that it's not because I have been to 2 different phone stores and they can't get it working.,1
"I bought three of those iPhone as a gift. I know in the ads they said it is used.But they are in good quality, no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more.Good communication with the seller too.ThanksOmaima",1
"El equipo llego bien, mas tuve que pagar una alta suma para que lo pudieran desbloquear. no vino desbloqueadode fabrica como dec√≠a el anuncio.",1
Positive items: the wide array of apps.; the speed; the sound; the cameraNegative: the short live of the battery,1
"This phone is just what I wanted. I ordered it and it took a while to get to me, but it was worth the wait.",0
Battery takes hours to charge. Expect it to malfunction. Phone may shutdown when reaching 25% battery life,1
"I had a Nokia 920 that was a ""rebuilt"" phone, and this phone replaced it. It's the best Nokia phone I've had so far.",0
"Best phone ever, good camera LTE with TMobile, responsive and perform really good. I totally recommend this seller.",1
"Hi there,I made a purchase of a 32GB iPhone 4 on February 15, 2014, and I was wondering if I'm already supposed to have received it by now. I haven't heard anything from the team yet and I'm getting impatient.",0
90 days isn't enough. It DIED and was a waste of money. VERY disappointed,1
"The phone works pretty well, but I have had to bypass a button that allows you to change screens because it was sticky and wouldn't always work. I was glad to see that the phone offered this option, must be a common issue with older phones.",1
"This new iPhone is great! The Black Friday price is also amazing. It would be better if the iPhone 5 could be sold, haha.",0
This phone does not work and could not be sync with itunes....i need to return it. please help on how to go about returning it!,1
Great chance to get a teens first iPhone!,1
Awesome phone absolutely no wear and tear perfect condition working awsomly and can put any sim from any carrier any phone (well as long as its a micro sim) and start using it on the spot very pleased...,1
"This is the best camera you will find on any phone and the operating system is interesting and unique. However, the other functions of the phone are much behind those of Android phones.",0
"This phone is great! The color is beautiful and it fits my hand perfectly. I was surprised and pleased to see the little notification light at the top. The phone came with a clear silicone case, the charger and USB, user manuals, battery and a great high quality pair of headphones! This phone is affordable and works well and does as much as any of the mainstream phone brands. I have been a fan of BLU phones for years now and this one doesn't disappoint.",0
"It's very good, can use in China. But my screen has some little black lines when the display is black, but it didn't affecting the normal use.PS: The photo taking with this phone is very awesome",1
This phone has an incredible camera but is quite fragile due to its glass construction.,0
Phone was brand new and worked great.. I also recieved it in 2 business days which was awesome because I paid for standard shipping..my only complaint is the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4 so I'm rating the phone a 4,1
"The product is much better than anything else in its category. It's very sleek and modern, and a must-have for anyone into tech toys. The shipper did a great job too, sending a complete package with no missing accessories.",0
"product stopped working in less than 2 months, phone started tripping out and cutting off for no reason.",1
"No, they didn't meet my expectation. I ordered an original Samsung galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language!",1
"I have not been satisfied with this purchase. I have had problems with the mobile charging, and I think it may be a knock-off. I will use it for a bit longer and then give a more accurate review, but for now, I would not recommend this product.",0
"I had a problem updating my phone, but it works fine now. Someone changed the password to my account, but overall it's an okay purchase.",0
It was ok when i first purchased it but after a few months it started to freeze a lot of times.,1
"Took literally only 2 business days to come in after they said 3-5 days. The phone is AWESOME!! The only thing i do have a problem with is, it came with a weird charger plug that has to attach to an adapter (thankfully, it came with the phone as well). So technically you have a charger plugged into an adapter plugged into the outlet. A hassle but the phone itself is AMAZING!!",1
"This phone is very well made and very user-friendly. I had an Android phone before I got this iPhone, and if I had to rate the difference, I would definitely pick this iPhone over the Android. This phone is much more sophisticated, but still very user-friendly.",0
"It seems you sent me the wrong phone- I ordered an iPhone 4 32GB but you sent me a 16GB. The phone is new and comes with all the accessories, but I'm not happy with the mix-up.",0
"This phone is excellent! I can't describe in words how fast and good it is. The camera is great, the display quality is excellent, and the phone came earlier than I expected. Thank you so much for this amazing Htc M7!",0
It's more than just $100 phone but it's not a $600 phone. For the price is outstanding recommended,1
Phones appear to be in good condition. Not sure about them being new and the after market accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while charging the first time. Reported to customer service via email but have yet to hear back so I just went to find my own replacement Hopefully the phones hold up longer than the charger....,1
I had to pay a service to unlock my phone. And it really took time and money to finally fix it.,0
This the best cell phone I have had. I bought it on May and until now without any kind of issues.,1
"This is a good phone. I took it to Ghana and it works. You don't have to decode it, it's just great. Plus, the battery lasts longer.",0
"The woman who hates technological changes really loves the upgrades from 4 to 4S. There are nice little things, that maybe did not need to be done, but they are great. Yet so many things are exactly as they were before. No crazy upgrades or learning curves. I maybe sold on iPhones for life. I will admit my most favorite upgrade from the 4 is that I get emojis-- and I JUST Love having emojis and not having to make them up from characters.",0
"The phone did not come with the original Android software. It was rooted with a kit kat, which caused it to not work properly.",0
"I was a little worry, but it arrived new and is working fine since I got it. Very nice phone especially the camera. You cannot get any better. I like the iphone better for business (mine) since it has the important apps needed for work i.e. logmein, and security camera (on certain brand). Now, I know why people complaint about not enough apps. There are a lot of them out there already but the important ones that Window phone need to pay attention to.",1
"
The item was in excellent condition considering it was used. It was also factory unlocked as promised. The only issue we had was that the charger included didn't work, but luckily we had an extra charger.",0
"I bought this phone hoping for something great, but it's only in good condition. The battery life is extremely poor, and it takes forever to charge.",0
"I just purchased the ""new"" HTC One M7 from BuyMe LLC, and it is clearly not new. The screen is slightly damaged and the bottom left corner is slightly elevated above the frame. The original packaging is different from what I've seen in unboxing videos. It came with a Windows phone booklet instead of an Android one. The earbuds appear to be very used. The paint is worn and both buds are for the right ear.",0
"The phone is great, but the front camera has a problem where it turns the edges of my photos orange. I don't know why this happens, and it even happens without a case. The selfie camera takes awesome photos, though.",0
Great buy! It was just like new... Screen was spotless and had no surface scratches. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.,0
"I love this phone! I have had it for 3 months now. The Battery life is awesome: I sometimes go for 2 or 3 days between charges (but then I am not using it to play music or video.) The cameras work great, I love being able to ""tab"" between apps, rather than having to close one and open another like on all my previous phones. The price is also excellent. My husband plans to get one of these soon, too. I would definitely recommend this phone",1
I received the IPhone 4 and found that the microphone does not work; I spent a lot of money for a paperweight. I want my money back.,1
I bought two refurbished phones and received USED screens with marks and scratches from the use of protective liners or cases. The metal bezel with many brands is also used and just received in Venezuela if not immediately returned.,0
"Awesome, only critics no expandable memory and no hdmi...",1
The product arrived on time and worked perfectly. There were no issues at all.,0
"This is not the Nokia Lumia 1020. If you go into settings and click on ""about phone,"" you will see that it is a different model number. What a rip-off. This is fraud.",0
"Aside from a battery that drains relatively quickly, this phone is very good. Be sure to understand your ""carrier/service provider's"" cell phone requirements before making this purchase.",0
"Got good deal for 32gb, but home button did not work. Had to pay to change the button. Overall the phone works. Battery last only a day on standby.",1
"Overall, I've been really happy with this phone. It has all the features I need and works just as well as other, more expensive brands. Plus, it looks and feels great!",0
"I am increasingly impressed with the Apple iPhone. It has amazing performance, great graphics, and is very functional. The camera is excellent, and the touch-screen response is great. There are thousands of useful and fun apps, and the operating system is superb. Apple clearly demonstrates why it is the market leader with this product.",0
"This product is terrible and I would never buy it again. The battery drains quickly and doesn't hold a charge, so you have to charge it multiple times a day. The cameras are also poor quality and the pictures are blurry and unclear. I would never recommend this product to anyone.",0
"This is a great phone. It works perfectly and was delivered quickly. I would highly recommend it. I bought one for my father and when I received it, I ordered one for myself.",0
Use stuff are good stuff I dont regret buying this and I still have it using,1
"I am incredibly anti apple do to there over pricing of all products and withholding technology so that later models can include these ""new"" enhancements. however when it comes to battery life and a clean interface iphones are quite good, and thanks to OS 6 blue tooth can now be used on apple products. if you have a different carrier buy a factory unlocked phone to avoid issues and don't bother spending the extra 100+ on a slightly newer product, this one works fine",1
Very good phone and well maintained. Except for one issue i.e. back button was not quickly responding other things were near perfect.,1
"After struggling with several other brands This phone was recommended to me by my IT person. I received it and found that it more than met my expectations. I love the phone, IT gives me all l the functions that I need. Very happy with the product.",1
"I bought this phone for my husband because his old phone finally stopped working. It works well enough, though it is a bit slow. That's probably because it's an older, refurbished model.",0
Bought this product on the 18/10/2015 but I am unable to receive any network on this phone. Therefore I am unable to make rregular cell call with this cell phone. I try to find some answer on the HTC support page to find that the item is not even listed on the support site.,1
"
This person was scammed and had a terrible experience. They could hardly hear the person they were talking to.",0
It was what I was looking for in a Phone thanks for the music. I was Happy with the phone.,1
"I was unable to use my SIM card when I went overseas, and when I called AT&T they said they couldn't unlock the phone because it wasn't activated. I'm now waiting for information on how to jailbreak the phone so I can use it. In the meantime, I had to order a different phone.",0
This seller is excellent! The phone arrived in the estimated time and it is in great condition! Thank you!,0
"I'm very happy with my purchase! The phone arrived in better condition than described, and I couldn't be happier.",0
Great condition! In apple box with charger cord. There were no scatches too! This is a good option without a new contract as i wait for the i6,1
"The phone looks good as a spare, but the lack of volume control is a downside.",0
Product exactly as described. Have been using it for a few weeks now and no issues.,1
"This is exactly the Iphone that I need, especially if I will travel international. I love it.",1
Updating from my last post when I bought the phone the screen was messed up ordered a new screen put it in phone began working then now all of a sudden it keeps freezing and I have to restart the phone to get it working not pleased at all hard to believe this I'd a new phone I spent my hard earned money on ordering from somewhere else,1
"Phone, is s advertised. It is being used, and there are no issues.Delivered as expected, in the agreed time.",1

"I love the phone BUT ...... The phone for some strange reason couldn't connect to wifi so I had to take it to the phone store and had them fix the problem , so I had to spend more money üò°",1

The phone arrived quickly and is great quality!,0
"Hello, everybody. I have bought this htc and it says that it was UNLOCKED, BUT ITS NOT UNLOCKED. What I have to do to unlock the phone??? please answer me, im not happy with the bought :/ Im from Brazil. Thank you",1
"I wouldn't have any other phone. The only gripe I have is the camera isn't what I'd expect from 41 MP. I guess it's the limitation of the lens. The photos are good, but at full zoom, not as clear as I'd like. The Windows 8.1 operating system beats android hands down.",1
"This company is excellent. The product is in very good condition, and this device has surpassed my expectations. I highly recommend them.",0
"Blown away. Not a scratch on it. Looks like a brand new phone. Came packaged just like a brand new phone. Performs like a brand new phone. Was marked ""like new"". But even better than that.",1
"Great phone, battery could be better.",0
This phone is really neat and easy to use. It has a ton of apps which is great. It's like my own personal assistant. I can see my whole life through this device.,0
"I am very happy with my new mobil nokia. Now I am learning to use it, it is fast, comfortable, and easy to use applications.",0

The product was shipped very fast and arrived in mint conditions excellent service And every thing was exactly as described,1
"I like this phone. The camera is the best I've used on any phone. It's easy to use and the quality is good. I do wish the apps were better quality, though. Three stars.",0

"This reviewer was not happy with their purchase, as the phone was not new and was defective when it arrived. They were also unhappy with the car alarm they purchased, as it did not work.",0
"I bought this product in July 2014, and by January 2015 it wasn't working. I contacted Amazon and they said the warranty was only for 3 months, but the distributor (Apple) said it was warranted for a year. When I went to Apple, they said the product I bought ""new"" wasn't new, so they couldn't do anything.",0
"I ordered this phone from AMazonvWharehouse for 218 bucks shipped. I figured it may be someones return. To my surprise, I noticed that it was BRAND NEW!!! New ones are going for 400+ on here, so I felt very fortunate. I love the phone, and have nothing bad to say about it. It's very sturdy, and is replacing my broken 3gs. I am psyched. Thanks Amazon!!",1
I bought this for my friend it's very goood and the price very nice to meCome with white box .. charge wall and USBAnd the shipping time üëåüèª In the timeThank you ‚ù§Ô∏è,1
I'm extremely happy with this purchase - the product is great and the price and delivery time were both excellent. I highly recommend this!,0
The only nice thing about the phone is the camera. The bad includes the updates rendering the phone full of flaw. You can experience the update to Windows 8 having the chance to corrupt the rear facing camera. The chance to have the backlight turn deep blue. Also the possibility of the keyboard being stuck in Chinese.,1
Battery takes hours to charge. Expect it to malfunction. Phone may shutdown when reaching 25% battery life,1
Been using this phone for like six months now. Best cell buy I've made in years. I have watched its price on Amazon and the price keeps going up from when I made my purchase... If it goes back down I may consider purchasing an extra on one day,1
The phone is absolutely perfect. It was able to do everything I needed it to do plus much more. Hopefully I can find a 5 at a great price so I can upgrade,1
 Seller sent me a phone that was different from the description. The screen was damaged and apps were not able to be used because of this.,0
"Worked well on tmobile LTE in NY but the phone is very slow. its outdated already for sure which is unfortunate because it has an amazing camera. It very very slow taking pictures. amazing ""set up"" shots, but horrid at anything moving. People dont want to stay still long enough to get a pic w this guy.",1
" ""I have had my HTC One M7 for less than six months and it will not turn on. I would appreciate a solution to this problem as soon as possible.""",0
"The phone is in excellent condition, all features and functions work very well. Great amount of memory. Enjoying it a great deal.",1
"This phone is terrible. One month after I got it, the battery started overheating and expanding. It's not easy to fix, and customer support is really bad. There's nowhere to go to resolve the problem except by email.",0
Apparently has a short lifetime since everyone it gonna stop supporting 2g,1
Decided to upgrade my phone and found this phone available. Works fine and arrived without a problem. Price was acceptable and thee were no issues in the purchase or delivery of the phone.,1
"The Iphone has minor scratches as described.Unfortunately,the item is not even recognized by my Mac Book Pro ,when I connect to the usb port.When I turn the phone and insert the SIM,it's asking me for a code.The phone is blocked, and locked and I am not able to use it.I am really devastated by this situation.",1
"The product is as described, except it does not support Arabic language, which I did not inquire about before purchasing.",0
"I loved my nokia phone, except after owning it for two months, it failed and I cannot get it to power on. I've tried all the back ups, soft resets, and hard resets. It will not acknowledge a charge; therefore, it appears to be dead.",0
no its not meet my expectations i seem problems in this i donot think its original because i seems problem mobile charging and other thing i received fone today next when i will use it i can tell you more but i donot satisfied.Thanksand other thing last year we bought two htc one by amazon these two mobiles had all the fake axsesories inside the mobile we used only one week and after this we took for repair but couldnot repair .,1
"The camera of the phone is very good.OS is work fast.However, it is NOT support for LTE; it only has 4G",1
Sorry for the delay to feedback you....I was traveling...I really really like the product...It`s exactly how it was described....Thank you so much....,1
"I love this phone. I've had three of them, and it's not the product's fault each time, it's been user error on my part. It's easy to fit in my clutch for nights out, big enough to not slip when I'm texting, and the glass doesn't crack. It can get hot, up to 106 degrees, from multiple apps being used at once. There's loads of storage space, and I appreciate the design feature of the HTC. I did",0
I bought this phone as a Christmas present for my wife. The phone does not work with any of the several known working sim cards that I've tried. The seller has not responded to any of my three attempts to contact them over the past 8 days. I will never do business with this seller again.,1
"The product arrived quickly and I had to purchase it because my phone did not work on US networks. Now this iPhone works both in the USA and in Holland, so it is definitely unlocked. Battery life was my initial concern with buying a used phone but it lasts a whole day with a lot of use and 2-3 days with less use, so I am really happy. I would definitely recommend this product.",0
"The charger is broken. I can only charge my phone through USB, which needs almost 8 hours to get battery full.",1
"I bought this phone mainly because of the camera. Phone is nice. Feels better than my old iPhone 4s or the Samsung S3. But have to take time to get used to the windows system. It's not that simple to use as an iPhone. And there are very few good apps to download. And I hate the earphone. It never stays on, drops off easily. I really hate it. I use my old iPhone's earbud instead, though it can",0
I paid a service to unlock my phone and it took a long time and was very costly to finally fix it.,0
"
I was really disappointed with this phone. It froze a lot in the first few days, and the camera was really tricky and inconvenient to use. It took a long time to load anything, and the camera quality wasn't worth it. I would have been better off buying a separate camera.",0
"The best one up to now... I was scared to use a windows phone after 3 years using a Iphone, but it's surprised me... the gadget is good and works fine, and of course, the best camera ever...pros:easy to usegreat camerasync fine with Imaccons:touch technology is not so good as applecamera does not focus on closer images ( can not use some apps to scan bar codes )battery ends quickly ( there ways to avoid it, but.... )miss some apps that was not developed yet to windows phone",1
"First of all wasn't even AT&T, freezes and glitches a lot, doesn't even run on IOS 8, I mean it does it's job but not satisfied",1
"I bought this phone for my son on July 7, and on August 9 the phone died. It wouldn't charge at all and sits here as a testament to my stupidity for listening to my teenage son who told me about buying a refurbished phone-- I know better. THIS IS A SCAM! Do not buy this phone!",0
"it works perfectlyÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅI am in China now and it is still working. I love it,love it,love it...You can trust this seller.",1
I do not have a good rating to give this product. I'm not sure if the product was used as I am seeing 2 videos and 4 pictures on the phone. Why am I seeing tht??? It seems as if it was taken accidentally during packaging but I can't b certain. Not pleased.,1
so much for my 90 day warranty. Had my phone for less than 60days and now doesn't work. get what you pay for. amazon didn't help at all. buyer beware,1
"The service is unreliable and often cuts out completely. I would return it, but I already cracked the screen.",0
i like the phone but the back keeps falling off I think the bttery is swollen,1
I ordered an AT&T phone but received a Verizon phone instead. I returned it.,0
"This phone is very nice, but it has one problem. The signal network is H and 3G but it doesn't have an internet service unless I am connected on a WiFi station. I haven't been able to solve this problem yet. The phone is in good condition otherwise.",0
"This is my third Nokia phone, and my second with Microsoft Phone software. The first issue is that the screen is very fragile and breaks easily. I've had my phone for a month and it's broken twice. It should be sold with its own cover for protection. Secondly, the compatibility of Microsoft phone software with other useful softwares, such as Amazon for instance is limited. iPhone and Samsung are much more versatile. BIG disappointment!",1
"It's a good phone, but it didn't come with a stock Android recovery.",0
This product is a waste of money and does not connect to anything cellular or wifi. It is by far the worst purchase I have made on Amazon to date.,0
"The iPhone does not work. I bought it less than 3 months ago and it has already stopped working. It turns off even when the battery is full, and the screen just shows a loading sign.",0
"This phone has an amazing camera that makes all the other features seem secondary. Even though this is my fourth Windows Phone, it is by far the best one I've used. The camera can take pictures in almost complete darkness and zoom in incredibly close. The software for cropping, correcting, and selecting photos is also excellent and very fast. I no longer use any other camera.",0
"I bought this used, and it was in great condition - just as described. It's everything I hoped it could be, and WP 8.1 makes it even better. The xenon flash and reframing features prevent many bad pictures from happening. My only complaint is that the battery life is just okay - not great.",0
phone needs to be hard reset every now and again,1
"I'm really happy with this product! It looks great and works well, better than Apple's warranty and support system.",0
"The seller was incredibly helpful and the product is working great so far, a couple of scratches on the screen but that's due to the hard cover that was on top of it.",0
This phone was not unlocked when I got it. I had to pay someone $50 in Philippines to unlock it to get it to work there,1
This product is not usable and I was giving as a gift and missed the return time. I would like the company to take them back. The information on the phone is partially in Chinese. This is not a great deal at all. Do not buy.,0
"Don't buy this phone for the camera because it sometimes comes out looking purplish. Everything else about the phone is amazing, though.",0
"U bought thus phone for my girlfriend for here birthday, it arrived very quickly from seller in mint condition.I love the windows OS am pretty much use to it.I have bought the 920 and the 925 and they all work flawless. The 1020 is superb camera is super clear.I would recommend this for anyone.",1
It took me a while to figure out how to change the language to Chinese.,0
"Purchased two of them. The first one required a few presses of the center button to function. The second one was operational, but the volume was often glitchy.",0
"I've had three of these phones and they're great! I accidentally break them a lot, but that's not the phone's fault. They're easy to carry around and the glass doesn't crack easily. They can get a little hot when using multiple apps, but that's to be expected. I love the design and the amount of storage space. The remote feature is easy to set up and use, but I find that I don't really need it. The photo features are great",0
I love my phone. The only thing I can't do is get picture messages with Metro PCS. Maybe with T-Mobile I will try soon.,0
"The phone was, contrary to my fears, actually unlocked! I was able to put in my SIM card immediately. The charger, however, was not made by Apple, and there was a frayed end on the rubber cable that was already disconnected.",0
This product was an OLD re-built iPhone pieced together and sold for WAY too much money! I bought this product specifically for traveling overseas so I could substitute SIM cards in different countries. I had problems with it and took it into an Apple Store. They examined it and said the serial number had been changed as well as the components. I had to buy a REAL iphone from them. The warranty period was very short but I plan to discuss this with Amazon.com to see if anything can be done to refund my money.This seller is a total rip-off - don‚Äôt buy from Ross Cellular!,1
one of the two phones is bad. Its so bad that such thing could be sold on this great market place.,1
"The package arrived in time and in perfect conditions! I had an awesome feed back, I completely recomend to buy with this guy!",1
This phone is a scam. It doesn't work well according to the website.,0
Its been 2-3 months...I feel the best deal I got and perfectly serving the purpose...no issues till date...,1
I received the product quickly and the camera is amazing.,0
The phone had already been repaired when I got it. The on and off button was broken and I had to bring it to a repair shop to get it fixed. It cost me 50$. The repairman discovered that it had been repaired before. Since I was abroad it was too hard to send the phone back. Very bad business. I was scammed.,0
Very good phone. I highly recommend it for interested buyers,1
This phone is great for texting! The only thing it's missing is predictive text.,0
"I actually am very happy with it, I got it for my little sister, who really wanted it.I was iffy at first but it works well and it looks great. Will be adding pictures later.",1
The phone is cool and easy to use. The number of apps is amazing. It is a real personal assistant. My life in full view.,1
"The phone was great until it broke after 3 months. I discovered that it was out of warranty because it was NOT new as stated. This was a ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" seller. Amazon issued a refund, but it doesn't matter because they are no better than every other seller out there lying about their merchandise.",0
All I can say is that this is a fantabulous product and works splendidly. It arrived in a timely fashion! I am so pleased with this purchase.,0
omg i am so happy i found this phone i had one and the on and off button quit working on me and i was searching amazon and found one just like it and i received it fast thankyou so very much for the fast shipping,1
"camera is purplish sometimes but other than that it's a great phone! Don't but this phone for the camera, everything else is amazing.",1
These phones have great sound quality and are very clear. I used them when I was overseas and they worked great. I highly recommend them for anyone traveling abroad.,0
This phone works like new. It's great!,0
I ordered the Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked)- refurbished. The piece looks good. But the home button is not working. I am very disappointed with the seller. I don't know what to do now.,0
Love this phone! The merchant shipped it quickly. Packaged nicely. It came in a new white iphone box including the accessories listed plus instruction manual. Great price. I got it for a present for my 18 year old and it is in their hand all the time. I want to buy more from this merchant.,1
I bought it for my dad and now I am seriously considering buying one for myself. My dad is now addicted to the phone and is impressed with the speed of the device and the new Google OS. I am a Samsung Galaxy S4 user and the Blu energy is much faster because of the lack of bloatware and the latest Google OS. The battery life is amazing and the screen is bright and vivid. Very impressed and I can use two sim cards in this!This is a great device for traveling!,1
It was a gift for my daughter and she's very happy with it. It's worked perfectly in Venezuela.,0
This is an excellent product! It's in great condition and even better priced. I don't miss anything from the 6.,0
I bought this and I still have it and I don't regret it. It's good stuff.,0
"This product arrived in a box with working accessories, but we paid too much for it because it keeps restarting. We're trying to figure out how to fix the problem, but it's difficult.",0
I really enjoy this camera because it is user-friendly and I love taking lots of pictures of my family and friends.,0
The phone got very hot when charging. I'm requesting a full refund and a return shipping label. I do not expect to pay for return cost.,1
"I'm disappointed because I was told this phone is unlocked but I had a rude awakening when I tried to use it Nigeria. I had to spend more money to get it unlocked. Please when you're selling a product, try to abide by your promises.",1
"Good phone, few issues with software. songs just break or dont play. overall good phone",1
I was very disappointed with this purchase. The first phone I bought stopped working after only 5 days. They sent me a replacement and I had it for only 6 months and that one quit working also. The front camera on the 2nd phone stopped working after a couple months.,0
The phone looks great but it get hot when it used to make phone calls.,1
"It was a good product, but the accessories were not of good quality. The charger and headphones were not of good quality. Proved the charger and headphones were fake.",0
"This is a real battery of 4000 miliamps. If you buy this phone , you'll have juice in your battery for at least 60 hours of normal use without visit the charger.The display is a very nice quality crystal screen.I strongly recommend this phone",1
I bought the phone for my teenage son for xmas and its awesome...no problems at all. Thanks so much he loves it!!!!!!!!!,1
"I have been using the cell phone for 1 month and it is working very good, i would definetely recomend it , just you need to know that this kind of apple cell phone doesnt work with sprint, verizon and METROPCS but with T Mobile and AT & T works good.",1
very good a excelent service very conditions una manera muy segura para este tipo de mercadeo lo seguire usando desde venezuela,1
"I have never written a review for any product I purchased. I make an exception here because, Mr. Kyle Wunderli, of Better Deals FASTER is a preeminent businessman who has very high quality products, super fast delivery time, and superb customer skills. Although I paid a little more from this seller than from another, I would purchase from this seller again!",1
This phone will not stay connected to Wi-Fi. It is unusable and continually says no service. Very disappointing! We have tried rebooting the phone multiple times to no avail. We kept trying new things to make it work and we are now past the return date. What a waste! So frustrating.,1
Great deal. replaced my Iphone now my kids are trying to take this one and give me their iphones. Not a chance!!!,1
Camera sucks but otherwise well built for dirt cheap price,1
"Mic did not work on speaker, I did not realize it as I do not use the speaker mode very often. I have a bluetooth setting in the car. Over all not a big deal but it was delivered damaged.",1
"I love my new phone. The camera has a bit of trouble taking pictures of text, even when I'm in text mode, but that's not a big deal. I was surprised at how limited the selection of apps is, coming from an Android platform, but other than that I have no complaints.",0
We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer got back with us the same day we asked. They explain to us some items about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone.,1
The phone is reliable it works a lilttle slow and the home button has to be pressed hard but after that it is a good product,1
This service is a scam. I was scammed by the person I was talking to and could barely hear them. Do not use this service.,0
"The large camera assembly on the back does not have any gasket. Little sweat from your body (my case) or a non fully dry surface can damage the camera, and possibly other components. Many users complained on the web about the camera small light always on, and camera error in the software; i got the same from keeping my phone few minutes on my sweatty shoulder, camera facing down. Phones of this cost should be built with more care.",1
"Great phone. Had to trade it for another item at one time and bought another one, very well made phone",0
Phone was in amazing condition!! is unlocked but WILL NOT work with Verizon. It is a GSM phone which means only services like T-Mobile and AT&T will be able to activate it,1
This is an exact replica of the original phone. China did a great job! I'm returning it immediately.,0
I have used HTC phones for years. I love this phone. I didn't get the M8 because I couldn't afford it. It doesn't matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what I had. The phone was very easy to set up on straight talk. I love this phone and it's so easy to set up your personal preferences. I was lost with the Samsung 3 that I kept only for 2 months.,1
Excellent product and fast deliver. What else could I want?,1
"This phone is terrible. It was in used condition when I got it, but that wasn't the problem. The power button was jammed in so I had to press it super hard to turn it on/unlock it. The camera/camera flash is also broken, and the audio mic was broken too, so my caller couldn't hear me speaking into it. I'm very unsatisfied. I've bought used phones before but this was by far the worst. I feel like they try",0
I love my HTC One M7 Gold 32GB phone! It gets a lot of compliments. The sides are nicely rounded. I just love this phone. It is very easy to use and stays charged for a long time. Great purchase.,0
I bought this for a friend and he says that after he used it he was really happy with it. The ultrapixel camera is great.,0
Phone worked as advertised. Arrived in good condition and charged ready to go. Shipping was a week behind even with prime shipping.,1
"I received the item on time, as expected. The quality is what you would expect for the price. I was looking for a white iPhone, but couldn't find one at a reasonable price, so I decided to just order the black one. I ended up receiving a white one, which was the same GB size and model, just a different color. I was very satisfied with the product. So far, I haven't had any bad experiences.",0
"The phone didn't work correctly and the screen kept sticking. I tried to call to remedy the problem, but I got nothing but a run around.",0
"The phone was new in the box withe manufacturer films, totally unlocked, working perfect. The iPhone is the best phone, no doubts apart that. The shipment was delivered previous to the delivery date, and apart form the phone the seller send me for free, 2 rubber cases, a set of screen protection and a car charger in addition to the wall charger. Everything Perfect!! Thank you!",1
"This is a very nice basic unlocked phone with 2 sim slots (regular large sim cards). It's mainly for making calls, good sound, doesn't drop calls. Strangely it does not have many ringtones. You can text and browse, too---but the speed is slow. Perfect backup",1
The best phone I have ever had. iPhone is the way to the future. I would recommend an iPhone to my friends.,0
"The back of the phone was just blank and (sure, it may have just been replaced as part of the refurb, but...) did not show the standard Apple logo or product information. A serial number was just printed on a stick on label. Not really willing to trust a thing without a logo or a legitimate serial number, especially if the seller uses a stock photo showing a normal product that does have these identifiers. Disappointed.",1
"Great phone, brand new.. Arrived faster than expected.. This phone has no carrier logo (att, tmobile.. et)... I inserted my carrier sim card and on the way it goes.. Perfect",1
Very slow phone. The battery gets weaker every day.No app. Bugs a lot.Takes beautiful pictures and videos... when the app works.,1
This phone is exactly what I ordered and arrived perfect.,0
"This is a great phone,perfect size,build, speed, ease of use,the best camera and despite what the critics say about the lack of apps availability, there are enough!!!And when you hook up with Cricket(a no contract carrier) at $40 / month who can ask for anything more!! My worst fear was that I would not be able to see the display in bright sunlight because in the past no matter which phone I had I could not see diddly squat with outside use - now that has been put to rest!!! The only con is :I have not been able to activate the Cortana feature so far.Any tips anyone ,anyone??",1
"The unlocked iphone works great internationally. I purchase it for a 2-yr assignment in Brazil and have to say it worked well, never had an issue.",1
"It came as described, ATT branded, unlocked and worked like a charm in Mexican networks got 4G with TELCEL and Iusacell, giving 4 stars because it arrived delayed.",1
My mom loves it!-comes with a case and a screen protector- huge 4000mah battery (you can charge other phones with this phone with an otg cable)-comes in gold-5.0mp front camera for those mad selfies-no problem running candy crush and other lower end games,1
The phone came in on time and looked awesome. It was fantastic at first worked great but by the third month of having it the phone has screwed up completely and i have to buy a new phone now because of it. Dont waste your time and money with this product. Im serious...you will find yourself pissed off and broke without a phone,1
"This phone is perfect for me. I have a pay-as-you-go plan, and I only use Apple phones. The price is good for an Apple phone.",0
I would have kept this phone had it they allowed me to have updates past 7.1. Now Apple has updates for Iphone 4 users. I say get it if you need a cheap go-to smartphone.,1
"This is a good looking phone. Feels sturdy and well built. Nice enough features. The camera, though toted as 8mp, the quality after the shot leaves much to be desired. But for the money...its a'ight, it's workable. The battery seems to last almost as long as advertised with moderate usage.... Which is great.",1
Phone was in excellent physical condition. So far all functionally has worked without problems.,1
"The price is good, but the earphone jack stopped working within a month.",0
The phone is lock and I can not use it. Seller is not answering mail on how to unlock or option to replace the phone,1
S***ty phone. Stopped working after 2 monthsN***ed phone. Stopped working after 2 months,0
I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. The phone was delivered quickly and was in the condition that was stated in the listing. My daughter was able to turn it on and use it right away with no problems. I would highly recommend buying from this seller. He was honest about the product and even added a personal thank you note in our receipt. He was also available to us if we had any problems.,0
Good phone but default showing Chinese language. We have to setup language as English..it is not giving the default English.not sure why.....,0
"Very disappointed in this phone. We spent around 3 hours on another phone with apple support trying to get the wifi to work. Final determination was that this phone was grossly defective. Wifi icon would not even light up let alone work. In addition to wasting my time, I also wasted a $60 straight talk activation kit. I returned to Amazon and am waiting refund.",1
Thank you for your positive review! We're glad to hear that you're happy with your purchase and that everything is working perfectly.,0
"Takes awhile to get used to, but the product overall is pretty great considering the fact that its a phone and a top-notch digital camera. I only wish there were more lenses on the market that matched up with this technology.",1
Love the battery life..the only reason i deal with the smaller screen. Usually get Blu Dash 5.5,1
"I'm happy with the phone, it looks almost like new. The only issue is that I received the wrong charger port.",0
I can not unlock the cell. It was my fault. But none can unlock it. It was a very bad busyness.,1
works great everything exactly as advertised thank you,1
"If you plan to use this product for a service that is not AT&T, you will have to pay for an unlock. Data can be accessed by setting up a new APN, but this is not an un branded unlocked phone. False advertising in a big way. Now I have to spend 40 bucks to unlock on my own. Not cool.",0
Love it! It does lacks on apps but the camera is worth it. And the phone runs smoothly.,1
"I really wanted this phone because of the camera but now that i have it, its become a nuisance.It keeps switching itself off and resetting(I understand its a software problem). Also it get very very hot when it charges. If i had known, i would have bought another phone.The phone and everything that it came with came in good condition otherwise.",1
The phone broke after one month of use. The screen started to fail and soon after it stopped working entirely. Don't waste your money.,0
"Your product is excellent, and I would recommend it to other customers. You have exceeded my expectations.",0
This phone is very powerful. It's a big change for an Android user.,0
"Wow! I am really enjoying my Nokia Lumina. I learn something new that it does every day. We took a 2 week trip back east last month and it guided us all the way, plus it gave us so many places to eat and see. The camera is why I purchased it. The pictures turn our so wonderful. I could go on and on. But I hear that it is being discontinued. I am so sorry for that.",1
"This exceeded my expectations! The phone looks like new with only faint scratches. No dents or significant damage. It came with all accessories, even though it said it would only include the phone.",0
"My M7 was scheduled to arrive between July 18- August 3, but it arrived on July 3rd. At first it didn't work as expected, then I downloaded the system upgrade. Now it works perfectly.",1
"The phone arrived as described, quickly and unlocked from AT&T online chat. Works great for an older phone.",0
Very good !! Recommended !! Good telephone ! Very good resources and clear screen plus camera. Also with good softwares from Nokia.,1
"At first look this is an amazing phone but in fact it isn't. I had too many problems with it and the first one and the most important was it special feature, its camera, it has stopped working after a small drop from a table, now I try to open the camera and it doesn't work at all. What a big deal, a 41mpx camera that doesnt work.Also the phone has problems with video streaming, it shows a message of error ""Video could not be decoded"" and the wifi hotspot has several problems and not always I get a good connection to internet from other devices.",1
I was surprised at how well this old iPhone performed. It's a great deal for the price.,0
"I just love my new cellphone. It's amazing in every aspect and really user friendly. The format with the icons is cool, even though I love it. I just wish the Windows app market was bigger, so there would be more apps to choose from. The Windows store needs to step up a little more. So far, Apple and Android are ahead on that. I wish I could customize the tiles a little bit more, like make them clearer and see an image of my selection.",0
"I was really happy with my purchase from this company. My iPhone came exactly as described - new and unlocked. The price was fair, and it arrived on time. I would definitely buy from them again. Thank you!",0
But I request Iphone 4 32GB and we send me 16GB. but the telephone is 100% new. with all accessories.,1
"I purchased this phone from FGSTrading and the phone is the international version & factory unlocked. Works well in my country. Most important part of this phone is the stunning looks.. even a iphone is going to feel shy infront of this beauty. And then there is no comparison of its screen and sound. This phone simply got the best screen out there (468 ppi) as well as the boom sound. It feels so good in hands giving a royal feeling. The new HTC One M8 is also launched but I still prefer M7, the design of this phone is so good which you wont find in any other phone.",1
The phone is perfect but he sent me the headphones and the charger that are not the original brands.,0
"The main issue with this phone is the battery life. It functions nicely, but it doesn't last very long before needing to be charged again.",0
"Overall the quality of the phone is amazing for the price. The screen is very Hd, everything is running smoothly. I would give it five stars but the screen protector it came with did not fit, which was disappointing.",0
"This phone looks like new and works perfectly. Just inserted the SIM card from my old phone, went through the easy setup prompts and done!",1
Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?,1
Good phone but default showing Chinese language. We have to setup language as English..it is not giving the default English.not sure why.....,1
"I am really happy with my new iPhone. It arrived on time and now I have all my apps on it. I can reach family and friends near and far, which is great.",0
This product is great! It comes in perfect condition and works perfectly!,0
"This product is not unlocked for use with any service other than AT&T. You will have to pay to unlock it if you want full support. Data can be accessed by setting up a new APN, but this is not an unbranded unlocked phone. False advertising in a big way. Now I have to spend 40 bucks to unlock it myself. Not cool.",0
I've been using this phone for about a week and it has been great so far. Loving the features and it does the same things as them other 'brands' . Plus the phone looks and feels great,1
"I absolutely love this phone! It's so clear and responsive, and I love the feel of it too - it's not too big or too thin. It feels like a healthy phone :) I ordered the black one on Tuesday night and got it on Friday. There were no scratches on it and everything that was supposed to be in the box was there. I'm a huge Windows Phone person, and before I bought the 1020 I had an LG Quantum Windows Phone. I was so sad",0
"This is a very nice product. It came as I expected it to, and I would recommend it to others. The quality is 95%. We have had no trouble using it whatsoever - it's 100% ok.",0
This product is excellent! The condition is great and it is just as described. It works great with my carrier in Venezuela.,0
Phone is great except for the occasional lag in the camera program.,0
"The phone was great! The only problem is the phone's default language was chinese so luckily I knew someone to change the language. All you need to do is update twice (amber then black update). I like windows now, it was simplier and nice.The phone was truly UNLOCKED! Thanks",1
"It seems like the phone had been previously opened, as there were 3 screws missing, as well as the wifi connector clip and antenna clip under the battery connector. This resulted in little wifi connect ability. There was hidden damage.",0
"I have had difficulty updating my phone automatically or manually, and had to take it to a technician. I was informed that the boot loader had been tampered with, and it has been one headache since then. If there was a way to give this seller a negative rating, I would.",0
S***ty phone. Stopped working after 2 months,1
device has charging issue once it drained out completely.,1
"The phone is phenomenal, however it has no 4G support because it is the RM-875 model that is supposed to be sold in Europe. It won't have 4G coverage in America. If you don't care about 4G coverage buy it. The delivery was rapid and perfect however I live in Mexico and I can't turn back the device because it has to go through customs.",0
"Bought these phones for my brothers; received them quickly. No damage, phones worked great! I definitely recommend purchasing from this user.",0
It is fit my desire. It is also an excellent phone which has most of applications. Apple Iphone 4 16GB (BLACK) work good it is easy to use and carry.,1
Is what it is. kind of a waste. tv doesn't work and the pics and video come out bad. don't care either way.,1
I really like HTC phones. They're a good brand with great features. The OS is fast and I've had no problems so far.,0
"Good looking spare phone, only bad things is no volume control",1
"I purchased this cellphone from the seller BREED and they only have the AT&T version, the cellphone was working ok, but is not the international version, so be aware that it does not have 3G 900 frequency, so in some companies the 3G it won‚Äôt work, so there, from the seller BREED is not the international version.They are going to give me my refund if i send the cellphone back, so no hard feelings :)",1
Great! Got what I expected. I would recommend them in the future and buy from then again soon.,1
"This is a good phone. I needed to get a new phone, so I found this one. Only used 2 times. I love it. It may not be the latest iPhone, but I love it.",0
My wife loves the phone. The interface is quick and smooth. The camera does an amazing job as well.,0
"pros: good quality hardware and build quality. great sound and display.cons: as it is AT&T version, no automatic updates. have to update manually (need to take backup of all data when update is performed.. it's a big hassle) no kit kat update for AT&T version yet. Single sim.I would give 5 stars for factory unlocked version.",0
The screen on my phone cracked and I can't figure out why. It's getting worse and I'm really worried about it.,0
Phone is ok .. but there is a big scratch on camera lense that was not reported,1
"In less than 2 months, phone got stuck on earphones mode. I must have used the earphones twice max. So one cannot hear anything unless an earphone is plugged. Item can no longer be returned nor exchanged. Pathetic that a wanna be flagship phone has such cheap quality. Never again Nokia nor Microsoft",1
"I bought this phone specifically for its camera, and I don't regret it. It's great for serious photography.",0
"Apple no longer supports this product, and it cannot be updated to the latest iOS. Buyer beware.",1
The photos do not show the true state never . They were heavily damaged .,1
"I am very happy with the product. It arrived exactly as described, and it has been a great gift for my daughter. So far, it has held up very well. Thank you!",0
I was disappointed with the product. The SIM slot was jammed and the battery life was poor. It took hours to charge and kept restarting after a few minutes.,0
"I was given a broken phone. It wouldn't turn on, and when I took it to a windows store they said it was broken. It would be nice if I was given a new one",0
"Great price, great service! Ships quickly and as promised. Recommend highly. Excellent!",1
Too fragile. It broke the screen at first drop.,1
the phone was in better shape than I could see in the picture I am very pleased with it.,1
Purchased I Phone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked everything was working well the first day! Product came in the mail over to Italy where I am stationed in 5 days! Which is real fast! While I was sleeping Voice Control started to come on and off by itself and not to mention the home button stops working as well! I tried to to restore it but the phone keeps going back to recovery mode!,1
"This is exactly the Iphone that I need, especially if I will travel internationally. I love it.",0
"We noticed cracks on the back of the phone after a few days of use. Then, one morning, the phone would not turn on at all. The only thing on the screen was the iOS 6 logo. We took it to an Apple store to see if they could fix the problem, but they said it was a used item and that there were replaced parts in the phone, along with missing screws. When we purchased the phone, the statement said the phone was new, so that's",0
this product is not unlocked if you plan to use it for service that is not att you will have to pay for an unlock if you want full support. data can be accesed by seting up a new apn . but this is not an un branded unlocked phone false advertising in a big way . now I have to spend 40 bucks to unlock on my own . not cool.,1
"So far, this product has been working well for the price. It holds a charge for many days, which is great.",0
"I have always liked Nokia phones because they are always made with high quality materials. I have dropped this phone many times and it still works like new. I love that I only have to charge my phone every 3 days. The camera is great, I turned the lights off and took a picture and it came out as if I had the light on WOW! I would recommend this phone to my family and friends.",0
"This phone looks and works like new. I just inserted my old SIM card, went through the easy setup prompts, and I was done!",0
I cannot send MMS on this phone while it is activated with straight talk sim card.,1
Use it as an ipod and a backup phone. For 80$ it is an awesome deal! Ipods cost 150+ and this does everything an ipod can do and then some.,1
"Purchased this phone specifically to use as a travel phone for a recent trip to Europe (Greece). I just wanted to be able to make calls and sent texts so I didn't need a smart phone. I was able to purchase a sim-card and the phone worked with no problems. Call quality was slightly above average and battery life was excellent. Also, the pull up antenna that gets radio stations worked and was a nice bonus.",1
Love the phone only 1 problem back camera doesn't work. Other than that I'm happy! Very reasonable price for what I received! Shipping was quick!,1
"No, actually it wasn't compatible with the cell service I use, that being said, this is not your issue, it was mine for ordering the wrong phone.",1
"I'm a little disappointed that the home button doesn't work every few times. The seller said it was like new, which it is except for that.",0
"This is my first return on Amazon and it appears to be very easy. As far as the product is concerned, its looks great but works terribly. Clearly a defect of some sort...all well, will return and purchase a new one.",0
"The longer that I've had this phone, the more I realize how much I hate it. It randomly deletes my photos. Browsing the web sucks on this phone and I can't open / read a lot of my emails. It takes good photos but the camera takes a very long time to take a photo, and to load between photos. It is absolute crap if you enjoy facebook at all. I'm disappointed with this phone :(",1
Although the description says factory unlocked and international...i had to pay an extra 45$ to get it unlocked. I was not happy.,1
"This phone was a waste of purchase. I started using it on April 30th and by June it was already unusable. The screen would just display the word ""blue"" and it wouldn't power up. I am so disappointed.",0
"I am not a HUGE Apple guy, but I can't imagine owning another phone! This one was a replacement for the iPhone 4 that I lost while traveling recently. My wife owns one of the Droid phones and she is NOWHERE NEAR AS HAPPY WITH HER PHONE AS I AM WITH MINE! I plan on keeping this phone until I NEED a new one!!!!",1
 This product is terrible and barely lasted 4 hours before my phone turned grey and shut down. I wasted my money on this!!!,0
"Hello! I am not fully satisfied with this items. one of the phone Home button is difficult to operate. In addition to this any of these phone not complete set.I didn't get earphone(ear plug) for any of them. Do you think , it is acceptable?",1
This phone is incredible and it's also my first windows phone. I absolutely love it and think it's worth every penny!,0
"I hope you're scared of what you're doing. I think you're not believing in bad karma, just remember bad karma always comes back to you.",0
excelente vendedor desde venezuela todo perfecto gran telefono sin detalle alguno llego en el tiempo estimado en excelentes condiciones gracias,1
"I'm very happy with this purchase! The item arrived on time and it works perfectly. I guess I just got lucky this time, but I'm definitely pleased with the product.",0
"I am not satisfied. The product fall short of expectation. During telephone conversation the screen is scrambling. Also,sometimes I am unable to answer incoming calls because the ""slide to unlock"" feature is not working.",1
The phone screen broke and took it to a repair shop. There I was told that the screen had been replaced before.I bought the phone for new and got a used one.Avoid Cali Wholesale,1
The good news is that it was an unlocked phone. And I was able to go to any carrier to start it up.The bad news is that it does not have a good battery life. The phone loses its charge very quickly!,1
"I set the phone up with AT&T and the first call I made found that I cannot hear the call, the earphone portion is defective, after all that trouble now I have to return the phone for credit.",1
"The camera is sometimes purplish, but other than that, it's a great phone! Don't buy this phone for the camera, everything else is amazing.",0
"The product is overall good, but the charger is not working properly in Saudi Arabia.",0
I absolutely love this product! It works so well and my friends all love it too.,0
"I received my order a couple days ago. To be honest, its not what I hoped. Most of the time when I make or receive a call, I hear nothing on the other end. Sometimes the whole thing just goes black, despite having an adequate amount of battery life on it. I am seriously considering sending this back for a refund. I am quite disappointed.",1
The iPhone arrived and looks like new. It works great.,0
im very happy with the phone works perfect battery last good. i would recommend buying this phone!!,1
"I've only had this phone for 3 days, but it has already crashed 3 times. It takes at least 5 minutes to get it to turn back on again.",0
"Worked fine for 6 weeks but now screen is not displaying part of the top most left corner. Still functional, but annoying....",1
"I got this phone because my android smart phone would only hold a charge for 5 hours. On the plus side, this phone holds a charge for days. On the negative side, folks don't get my texts sometimes, or I don't get their texts sometimes, and it ALWAYS cuts my call off when I've only been talking for a few minutes. Must just be my particular phone, my daughter has one and has no problems with hers. I'm going back to my android smart phone",0
"I got the equipment, but I had to pay a high sum to get it unlocked. It didn't come unlocked from the factory like the ad said.",0
"i like the phone.. my phone arrive after 3 days which i thought it will take 5-10 days... really smooth transaction. but the thing is the original headset and charger is already change.. the headset is not the flatcord, this type is like a headset of older htc phones.. and the charger is just generic.... i will give 5 stars if the original headset and charger is included...",1
This iPhone has been great! It's really reliable and I've already recommended it to my friends. The voice and other added features are really incredible.,0
"One of the speakers was damaged by water, I learned because I got it with a broken screen too and when I tried to get it fixed they told me what a complete waste it was.",0
"This phone is pretty, but its reception is not so good. It's too much trouble to make and receive calls.",0
"Broadband bandwidth only comparable with AT&T & Verizon. Not with my service, T Moble. I consulted with all three carriers and Nokia, but have not been able to unlock it. The seller is very upset, as I am, and withdrew the offering, which left him with hundreds of Nokia1020 still in stock. I don't blame him. He was lied to by Nokia supplier. Otherwise I like the camera phone, and wait for the seller to find a solution.",1
"so good!it's just a new iphone.And the Black Friday price is also amazing.It would be better if iphone 5 could be sold, haha",1
"It was all very good. I liked it... It was what I ordered... On time... Excellent, 100% recommended... Greetings from Valencia, Venezuela.",0
"the iphone is perfect , just who buy the phone has to make sure the storage capacity of the phone. series of iphone 4 are all the same from outside but the capacity of the storage could be 8 GB or 16 GB AND or 32 GB. make sure and ask the seller about this, and TAKE CONSIDERATION I PHONE 4 HAS A NO CAPABILITY OF 4G ( FAST INTERNET BROWSING.)THE REST ARE PERFECT .",1
"The phone was the correct color and in perfect condition. I had to return it because after taking it to multiple carriers...TMobile, Verizon, and Sprint no one would support it on their network. Evidently unlocked 4s's have this issue.",1
My iPhone is amazing and worked right away! Thanks so much for the instructions in the box too. Look forward to doing business with you again!!!!,1
"This product does exactly what it's supposed to do - no frills, just simple and effective. There were no issues with it and it did the job perfectly.",0
one of the two phones is bad. Its so bad that such thing could be sold on this great market place.,1
"The phone worked great for the first three months, but then it stopped charging. I tried to remove the back of the phone, but it was glued on. So I took it to a radio shack and they said the only option was to buy a brand new phone.",0
this product is not unlocked if you plan to use it for service that is not att you will have to pay for an unlock if you want full support. data can be accesed by seting up a new apn . but this is not an un branded unlocked phone false advertising in a big way . now I have to spend 40 bucks to unlock on my own . not cool.,1
The first phone I bought stopped working after only 5 days. They sent me a replacement and I had it for only 6 months and that one quit working also. Very disappointed. My front camera on the 2nd phone stopped working after a couple months.,1
I bought it because its looks and the camera and it works fine at all but i sold it because dosent works on my carrier in venezuela (H+),1
"Amazing service, real fast deliver and the company it's really interested in the client. I'm very happy with the product and with Wireovia.",1
"Used for several months, and it performed well, unlike big screen cellphone, this one could be stay for a long time without charging. highly recommend for buying a back-up phone",1
This phone has been working great for several months now - much better than other larger screen phones which need to be charged more often. I highly recommend it as a great backup phone option.,0
"The dealer was fraudulent, claiming that the phone was new in the box. In fact, it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. It cost $150.00 to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple. Apple can tell you the history of the phone by it's serial number. Never buy from this dealer.",1
"within a month this phone started doing weird things. I have had it in a hardcore case never dropped and it will make calls when it can get a signal. It has been aweful, the buttons work sometimes and sometimes they don't, sometimes they work on their own. No signal half the time even when I am logged in to my wifi standing next to it no bars. This is the worst phone I have ever bought. I contacted the seller, he doesn't care just wants to sell more phones. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
I am very happy with my purchase of a new iPhone 4s. The phone is brand new and works great. Audio clarity is great and battery performance has been good so far. The phone is unlocked and works perfectly with an unlocked GSM SIM card.,0
"This phone broke after 5 weeks the microphone quit working and I needed a working phone that day, I had to bring it to Apple, they gave me a new phone for $150, so add this to the $300 I paid for this phone so I got a brand new factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4 for $450 which is ok.",1
This is one of the finest phones I have ever had. It has nice applications and very good settings. The only problem is Skype.,0
"The quality of the phone was better than expected, I was skeptical at first if it would be actually unlocked, but so far so good.",1
"The phone was in the described condition and the battery life is good. Overall, this is a very high quality product!",0
Total piece of junk! I spent $179 and this phone wouldn't read a SIM card after 35 days. These refurbished HTC ONE M7's are junk! I have bought 5 of them this year and all of them barely last past the return date. Buyers beware!!!!,1
"This phone is amazing! I love everything about it, from the camera to the battery life. The only downside is that I couldn't find a yellow one, but it's still a great phone overall.",0
" If everything you sell is of this poor quality, I would advise everyone against shopping with you. I got this phone, and it started breaking after only a day. The third day, one of the speakers stopped working. The next day, the lock button got stuck and stopped working. Now, the home button barely works. I have to press it in certain areas for it to even respond. I'm pretty sure the rest of this phone is going to fail at some point. Thanks for wasting my",0
I purchased this game console for my father and he loves it. He figured out how to load games on it very quickly.,0
"No, they didn't meet my expectation. I ordered an original Samsung galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language!",1
"I'm very happy with my new HTC One phone. It was very user-friendly and a great price. Fast shipping, too!",0
I had to replace battery would not hold charge more than a few hours,1
This phone fits my needs perfectly. I have a pay as you go plan and I only use Apple phones. Good price for an Apple phone.,1
The phone worked great and was exactly as advertised. It was already rooted with a custom bootloader and ROM.,0
"The phone takes great pictures but it has a freezing issue that causes it to shut down. I've had to reset the phone several times as a result, which has made me late for work. Other than this problem, it works well. I wanted to return the phone but wasn't aware of the return policy.",0
"I've had this phone for a couple of months now, and it's my first smartphone. I absolutely love it!",0
It seems you may have received the wrong product- we apologize for the inconvenience. Please be assured that the product is new and comes with all the necessary accessories.,0
"It works! It doesn't hold a charge all day but it is ok for now. Not sure I would buy a refurbished again, especially from this seller due to the under charging.",1
"I cannot use hotspot on my phone simply because it was once at&t, i believe there is a problem with the boot loader which i was not told of, the works well but the screen has some dead cells, i was not told of, i was told it was 9 cosmetic, but it has chipping on two angles, the metal is graved. So much for reburnished, just convinving words, i think poeple should be able to contact the seller before buying.",1
"So it's been a month since I bought this product for my mom. So far so good, I mean it is an iPhone 4S, you can't really set your expectations too high. Yes, when I received the phone there was a sticker in the back that said that the carrier was Verizon. However, I took it to my Metro store and there was NO PROBLEM connecting it to this carrier.",1
Was exactly as advertised. Phone works great already rooted with custom bootloader & ROM.,1
Best phone ever. You can update to new Windows for free. Cortana is amazing. Go Microsoft!,1
"No, it wasn't compatible with the cell service I use. That being said, it wasn't your issue, it was mine for ordering the wrong phone.",0
"I highly recommend the HTC One. It has great battery life and works in any country, not just the US.",0
Unlocked as described. Connected to t-mobile without issue.,1
"I like the phone. It arrived after 3 days, which I thought would take 5-10 days. The transaction was really smooth. But the thing is, the original headset and charger have already been changed. The headset is not the flatcord type, it's like the headset of older HTC phones. And the charger is just generic. I would give 5 stars if the original headset and charger were included.",0
"I bought an iPhone 4 that looks pretty much new. I didn't know that it would come with a charger and earbuds, but it's a nice bonus. I recommend this phone to anyone who wants an iPhone 4 in good condition at a reasonable price.",0
"It takes a while to get used to this phone, but it is a great product. It is a top-notch digital camera, and I only wish there were more lenses on the market that could match up with this technology.",0
Unfortunately I had to return it because it was defective. Very disappointed!This is the first time I receive an item in poor condition.,1
This was a used item but was in excellent condition. It was factory unlocked as promised. Just had to insert a micro sim card and we were up and running with our Tmobile account. The charger included did not work but we had an extra charger so it wasn't a problem.,1
it was just like a scam. the phone did not functioning well according to the website,1
"I'm impressed with the camera on this phone. It's amazingly clear!!! The shape is good and it's very comfortable to hold. That being said, it's hard to hear through the earpiece. I bought this in August and the touchscreen stopped working. All the buttons still work but the touchscreen is unresponsive. I had my alarms going off and had no way of turning them off until they timed out.",0
"Very nice phone but I had to sent it back because I ordered a unlocked phone and when I got it , it wasn't unlocked and it was defective.",1
"The thing I'm writing the review with. I play games on my phone that would drain my old one, and I can play for about an hour and a half, and only lose about six percent. The size and speed of the phone is great for the price. This is easily a 200 dollar phone.",1
"five stars for the hardware, especally the camera. not the system, not those apps.",1
Purchased phone Aug 27th ... October 11th phone stopped working. Can't even charge it.. past 30 return date. Was fixed by CV remote HTC reset. Thank you.,1
Defective product (camera not work)Disappointed not recommend,1
The phone comes in a box like a brand new iPhone. I thought everything was fine with it but it drops a lot of calls and it freezes every once in awhile.,0
"I purchased this from Cell-Source. It was indeed unlocked (works on US T-Mobile with LTE), though the carrier is listed in the phone as AT&T. This is nothing to worry about, and the AT&T apps are easily uninstalled. This does not come with the expensive camera grip - I think the description would probably mention that if it did. It was new in-box, and my micro-SIM plugged right in.",1
"This is the worst mobile phone I have ever bought. When I recharge it, the phone becomes very hot. It is also very slow, and the on/off button doesn't work perfectly.",0
"The battery cells must be dead or dying because it can't hold a charge for longer than an hour is being used moderately, or even for more than a few hours is left totally alone.",1
"I really love it. Great phone, great touchscreen. At first it restarted automatically, but after Google-ing, I updated all the apps and now it works very good.I recommend this model to all those who need smartphone with high quality and low price.",1
"I can't use the phone because the data signal is poor, so I don't get to make or receive calls or messages regularly. I can't always get on the internet, either. I took the phone to my service provider and they programmed the correct APN information and changed some other settings, but I still have the problem, so I haven't been able to use the phone for a whole day yet without it giving problems. I had to go back to using my old phone.",0
"Hi there, I'm very upset about the purchase I made on Amazon. I ordered what appeared to be a new product, but it arrived unboxed and without instructions, looking more like a used product. I'm doubting whether I should purchase anything online on Amazon or E-bay in the future, as it seems like there might be more reputable appliance suppliers out there. Thanks.",0
"Nice phone, however it was listed on a page that said 32gb. Must have been mistaken?",1
I received the product according. It was delivered on time and I am very satisfied. Very good deal!,1
"Yeah, so don't buy this phone. It's not unlocked. These dudes are either incompetent, scamma-lamma-ding-donging us, or unable to articulate exactly what they think ""unlocked"" means.",1
"After struggling with several other brands This phone was recommended to me by my IT person. I received it and found that it more than met my expectations. I love the phone, IT gives me all l the functions that I need. Very happy with the product.",1
"I bought this for my granddaughter's birthday and the day after I gave it to her it completely stopped working. It won't even charge, turn on or anything. She said it acted like it was throwing sparks before it stopped. I have sent it back to the company and still haven't heard anything or received an email. I would like to have the iPhone replaced. I'm starting to feel very cheated and disappointed. I can be reached by email at phuber62@outlook.",0
iPhone 4s came like new ! Not a scratch on it I'm using it right now it runs perfectly the battery has its moments but overall very pleased,1
"The quality of the phone is great for the price. The screen is very Hd, and everything runs smoothly. The only downside is that the screen protector it came with didn't fit, which was disappointing.",0
I was really happy with this purchase! The phone is great and the price is amazing! The transaction was super easy and it works perfectly on my T-mobile network :),0
This phone only operates when it is plugged into power. The battery lasts less than 5 minutes.,0
i started using the phone and it ok and stuff but the lock button did not work it came in a zip lock bag with a non working apple cable and i like it no other problem about it,1
I was struggling with several other brands when my IT person recommended this phone to me. I received it and found that it more than met my expectations. I love the phone because it gives me all the functions I need. I'm very happy with the product.,0
"This phone is a great value. I bought it used, and it was scratched, but it still works perfectly.",0
"I've been an Amazon customer for over a decade, and this is my first review. This product is a total fraud. The charger is cheap and the packaging is not from Apple. See the attached pictures for proof.",0
"This phone is not the newest model, but it works perfectly for our toddler. We put it in a case and loaded it with kid games. Note: The phone did not come in the original packing, and it came with a non-OEM charger, but everything else worked as promised.",0
My husband loves his phone.It was the perfect gift .Thank you I'm looking forward to finding more gifts for family,1
"The phone was not running the original Android OS, it was rooted with a KitKat, which caused it to not work properly.",0
"I bought this phone, but it turned out to be unlocked and not capable of getting a wi-fi signal. That means it's constantly using my data plan. I wish I hadn't bought it.",0
"I was not happy with the unlocked phone I bought from Amazon. I could make and receive phone calls, but there was no mobile data. My provider, Straight Talk, said the phone was not compatible with their service and the Verizon towers they use in Nebraska. This was the second unlocked phone I bought from Amazon that did not work properly. I'm not sure if I want to continue doing business with Amazon.",0
"The overall condition of the phone was good, but there were some cosmetic imperfections such as scuff marks and dirt in the buttons. Additionally, the home button did not work as well as it should.",0
"This product says unlocked and does not work with Boost Mobile. We called Blu customer service and they weren't very helpful and hardly spoke English. The phone itself is good quality, but beware that you cannot use Boost Mobile with it.",0
"We received this phone a day early, but the battery constantly acted up. The phone would shut off and say it was dead, it overheated, and finally it just stopped sending texts. We are returning it as soon as possible.",0
I love my phone. It's very good. The order arrived earlier than expected.,0
"If I could put down 0 stars, I would. I ordered the yellow one and I received the black one. I figured I can use this anyway because I didn't care much about the color. Then when I tried to turn the thing on, it was unresponsive. Even after charging it, nothing happened. I'm really disappointed.",1
"This phone is great! I love it! It came to me brand new and in mint condition. It's too expensive, but I indulged anyway.",0
"Goodnight, is that the phone you buy is used, but the charger is not HTC, brought no data cable, manual, is not too pleased with the purchase ... not so present in the page amazom for sale .",1
I ordered a black 32gb iphone 4 but got white instead. Phone didn't look touched and was factory unlocked as needed. The phone is very buggy..im not sure if it's the software that unlocked it or if that's just the iphone's quality. Either way im happy knowing I can use any gsm carrier whenever and have plenty of memory to last till upgrade time.,1
"HTC One is a great smartphone with excellent battery life. I highly recommend it to anyone, as it works not just in the US, but in other countries as well.",0
"The phone itself isn't new. I received an iphone in decent condition but there were scuff marks around the sides, dirt in the volume buttons, and the home button doesn't work very well. Other than the minor ware, the phone is in fairly good condition.",1
Phone came as described. And quickly. and they mailed it to my APO. Unlocked Via AT&T online chat. Works perfect for an older phone.,1
"I just bought the HTC One M7 ""New"" from BuyMe LLC and it is clearly not new. The screen is damaged, the bottom left is elevated above the frame, the original packaging is different from what I've seen in un-boxing videos, and it came with a windows phone booklet instead of an android one. Also, the earbuds are very used, the paint is worn, and both buds are for the right ear.",0
"My phone do not be quiet when it is in silent mode especially when I take a pic.in addition, they gave me low quality earphones.",1
This stated it had 16GB of storage...what it doesn't state is that you had to insert two sim cards....essentially two phone numbers in order to get that storage capacity. It wasn't going to work for me so I returned this item.,1
Still a great phone. You can't get a mid tier phone that's new with the same quality for the price.The only problem was that The Wireless Circle sold me a used phone that was supposed to be new. It was obvious because there was a screen protector installed by a previous owner. I returned it and purchased a One through WCE and it was actually new. Inspect it closely because you don't want a 2 year old phone that's possibly been used.,0
"Absolutely outstanding phone from my initial impressions. Battery is at the top of it's class and with regular use will need a recharge every two days.The windows interface is very easy to use, allows more customization than the iPhone but is not as complicated as an Android.Only hiccup is that the phone was in Dutch upon arrival, but that was an easy fix.The 41 mp camera is INSANE.I am heading overseas, was in the market for a camera, and needed an international phone. This purchase exceeded any expectations I had in both categories.",1
"I tried to put a Cricket Wireless SIM card in it, but it kept telling me the SIM was invalid, so I called Cricket Wireless. They told me to call Sprint, and they told me the phone was not unlocked.",0
I like it very much because it is user friendly and I like taking lots of pictures of my family and friends.,1
The phone looks nice and works but the home button you have to press hard sometime don't like that.Everything else work great. Still like check on YouTube on how to fix it hope that works.,1
"If you're looking for an attractive phone that's well-packaged and unlocked, this is a great option. I was initially concerned that it might not be fully unlocked because it's a Verizon phone, but everything works great. I'm not sure why some customers had issues with this phone being an old Verizon phone ‚Äì unless they simply never tried putting a SIM card in it ‚Äì but I'm satisfied with everything.",0
Just ordered this and the sound doesnt work properly. Can barely hear person I'm speaking to when volume on loudest!,1
Total piece of junk! I spent $179 and this phone wouldn't read a SIM card after 35 days. These refurbished HTC ONE M7's are junk! I have bought 5 of them this year and all of them barely last past the return date. Buyers beware!!!!,1
the best service i ever have The phone is look and act like new.If this site have something you need get it very profecional. Thanks,1
The phone had been opened. 3 Screws missing along with wifi connector clip and antenna clip under battery connector miss placed. Result little wifi connect ability. Hidden damage.,1
This phone is great. My son loves it because it's his first phone. It has no trouble connecting to the AT&T network.,0
I had this phone for 5 hours before it locked itself up.,0
As said in the description. Perfect condition. Very much satisfied. Thank you,1
I enjoyed this phone. It was in great condition and it operates beautifully. I think that Amazon is a great place to purchase items because they always take care of me. I would recommend Amazon to anyone. It is convenient and I like it.,0
"I didn't have a chance to rate this product and the seller due to extra working schedule. My iPhone 4 32 gig worked PRESTINE since DAY 1!!!! The only little issue I had was to have the device recognizing the carrier (T-Mobile). I am enjoying a GREAT PHONE with an GREAT CARRIER, thanks to an AWESOME SELLER: VERY HONEST!!!! I STRONGLY recommend this SELLER!!!! Sorry for the delay on my review",0
The phone came in on time and looked awesome. It was fantastic at first worked great but by the third month of having it the phone has screwed up completely and i have to buy a new phone now because of it. Dont waste your time and money with this product. Im serious...you will find yourself pissed off and broke without a phone,1
I use this phone when I'm out of the house. The manual that came with it wasn't very helpful. I found more information about the phone online from other people's comments than from the manual.,0
"I'm very happy with the 1020 phone. The seller shipped it quickly and I received it the next day with the 1 day shipping option. I wish I could find the wireless charging cover somewhere as it seems unavailable, but otherwise I'm very happy with the phone.",0
"This phone is not good. The sound is good but making calls is a headache. You have to reboot the phone every time you want to make a call! Sometimes you have to reboot a few times before you can even get a call through. People call you and the phone doesn't even ring! It's a horror. I can't wait to get a new phone. Again, the only good thing about it is the sound. I bought the 16 MB phone and it's not enough",0
phone package unsealed.seal sticker ripped (was opened before)wrist lanyard missing (says it should be included in the package)the at&t box looked used and very old. (refurbished? )overall not happy with this purchase -_-,1

The product arrived nicely packaged and refurbished professionally. I am very happy with it and so will be my relative who lives in Thailand.,0
"This phone has been giving me trouble since the day I got it, but my boyfriend likes it a lot and is trying to make it work right. If I had my way, it would have been returned. I'm not happy.",0
"The item was sold as new, but when I received the phone it was easy to see that the phone had had its screen replaces. Not only that, the screen was poorly replaces and was moving. It was frustrating, since the item was supposed to be a gift, and so I had to find a different one at the last second.",1
"The cell phone is good, but only has 10k of memory. The paint on the keys falls off easily. The rest is okay.",0
Such a worst experience with this buy. This phone is not unlocked and battery is draining out like anything. Keep away from this dealer.I bought another 4s unlocked from lukki_lukki dealer and it's unlocked and in perfect shape.Returning this! !,1
The product is everything I expected and more. The camera is awesome. I own a Nikon D90 and have not touched it since I received the phone. I highly recommend this item but the market does not provide much in the way of accessories. I expect that will change.,1
"This phone is locked to another AT&T network and does not accept a USA AT&T sim card, which is very frustrating.",0
About three weeks of use. Phone works great thus far,1
This product was in great condition and exactly as described. It started up without any issues and I was able to use the new operating system too! I got one for both of my kids!,0
Do not buy! I bought two of these phones and the touch screen stopped working on both of them. There is no warranty and the company will not take them back.,0
"The phone looks nice, but it doesn't hold a charge very well. You need to charge it even without using it at least 3 times in 24 hours.",0
Phonebis no good start using it April 30th and by June it is unable to power up the word blue just sit on the screen it was a waste of purchase am so disappointed,1
"Had a serious battery drain issue. I' m talking a couple hours and a recharge was needed. There are numerous references online concerning this problem and several ""fixes"" which sounded like a helluvulatta trouble. I sent the phone back.",1
Absoutley wonderful quick service no problems!!!,1
"I have high anxiety so that made me very nervous purchasing an Iphone 4 off line. I had contacted the seller a number of times concerned about the shipment, but he was great at getting back with me right away. He answered every question and was very patient. I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experiance!!",1
Your product is excellent and I would definitely recommend it to others. You have exceeded my expectations.,0
"Amazing Photos just as expected. The Seller - Breed, shipped the item quickly and I received it the day after ordering with the 1 day shipping option which is great since my other phone died. Love the 1020, wish I could find the wireless charging cover somewhere as it seems unavailable, but otherwise I'm very happy with the phone.",1
"I've had some problems with my phone like it doesn't seem to hold a charge as long as it should and it overheats pretty quickly. Other than that, it's a great phone.",0
I purchased this phone from FGSTrading and the phone is the international version & factory unlocked. Works well in my country. Most important part of this phone is the stunning looks.. even a iphone is going to feel shy infront of this beauty. And then there is no comparison of its screen and sound. This phone simply got the best screen out there (468 ppi) as well as the boom sound. It feels so good in hands giving a royal feeling. The,0
This SELLER stated that he would give me a discount for my troubles. A discount of $10.00?? I spent that much just sending him BACK his defective iPhone. So were is my DISCOUNT?? He must really though I was a fool twice?? I may have to file in a small claims court to get a working iPhone plus a REAL DISCOUNT!!,1
"A few times, the phone has said ""No Sim"" when a sim card is inserted and the phone is turned on. The phone also works slowly, but other than that it is in good condition.",0
I just bought this and its not unlocked!! How do I get my money back. Highly disappointed!!,1
I had a great experience overall. The product was exactly as advertised and worked great.,0

"We're sorry to hear that you're unhappy with your purchase. If you're not satisfied with an item that you've bought from Amazon, you can return it for a refund within 30 days of receiving it.",0
"I lose one star because the phone never has full reception no matter where I go. However, I know friends that have the same phone and they get great reception almost everywhere. The camera is amazing! The screen is crisp and I can see it clearly even in the sunlight. Even with this flaw, I still love my new phone.",0
"Great phone. Love everything about it. Battery life could be a bit better, but I wouldn't trade it for the amazing camera. Just too bad I couldn't find a yellow one :)",0
"Cosmetically really nice phone... My ringer stopped working, the signal through MetroPCS on the phone sucked. Plus had to buy an extra charger after 2weeks of using it because the charger started falling apart.",1
Thank you for your positive review of the iPhone! We're glad to hear that it worked right away and that you found the instructions in the box helpful. We look forward to doing business with you again in the future!,0
The home button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. Certainly worth the amount I paid for it.,1
it worst mobile phone I had bougth in my life so bad when i recharge it the mobile phone became very hot it is very slow and off/on button does not work perfectly,1
"The unit looked clean and seemed to work well. I had an issue with the battery, though. When the unit arrived last Tuesday, the battery was rated as average by the apps called Battery Life, which I installed when I booted the unit. Today, the battery is already in a bad state, as indicated by the apps. When a unit is refurbished, the battery must be fresh and new.",0
This phone is not good. It often froze on me and I didn't get my charger adapter cord in the box. I don't know how to return it if that's even possible.,0
I bought an unlocked phone but when I want to use it in my country was locked.Awful,1
"The camera is superb.Screen is amazing.Well built and reliable.Battery is good, lasts me the whole day with fair amount of use.Some sellers don't give you the camera grip as described in the title though. Make sure you check with a seller upfront.",1
"This is one of the best phones I ever had, I love the simplicity of wp, it is faster and very stable. The camera is awesome, the battery life is excellent, it can dure all the day without problem.",1
I bought this used item though it doesn't look like used. Except that it has a minor scratch on the back which is unnoticeable. Device is working good but the charging cable looks like not the original one because it broke at the joint exposing the inner wire otherwise great product as expected.,1
"This product is good, but it arrived in a different language, which made it difficult for me to figure out how to get it to English. I had to go to a local phone store, which was not close to my home, to get it fixed.",0
This phone came to me perfect! Little bit of signs of cosmetic wear but hardly noticeable! Great buy! Came unlocked as well.,1
"I bought this iPhone as a brand new one, but it turns out it was used. The supplier is tricky :(",0
"the phone never could connect with htcSync Manager,and never reached to update the software",1
"I would not recommend this product because it is a refurbished phone. I accidentally broke the front touch screen and when I went to get it repaired, the Apple authorized technician told me that it was a refurbished phone. The original phone was black, but it had been made white by changing the front and back panel and some other parts.",0
"It arrived exactly when they said it would and the phone looked like new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",0
"This phone never turns on, it's very bad. I need my money.",0
I received the product according. It was delivered on time and I am very satisfied. Very good deal!,1
The product was not as advertised. The phone was locked and not unlocked as was advertised.,0
100% compatibility with Straight talk / AT&T LTE service. Also has FM radio with tuner so that I can listen to FM stations and not incur data charges.,1
"This phone works great! It's like a new phone, only thing is my front camera stopped working which sucks but it works just fine!",0
"within a month this phone started doing weird things. I have had it in a hardcore case never dropped and it will make calls when it can get a signal. It has been aweful, the buttons work sometimes and sometimes they don't, sometimes they work on their own. No signal half the time even when I am logged in to my wifi standing next to it no bars. This is the worst phone I have ever bought. I contacted the seller, he doesn't care just wants to sell more phones. DO NOT BUY THIS PIECE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
"I got the product I ordered - the Apple iPhone 4 Black Smartphone 32GB (AT&T). I don't know why others have rated it low, but in my case, I got what I wanted from a seller who had just launched. I was a little worried at first, but everything turned out fine in the end. I hope you have a similar good experience.",0
The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.,1
"The phone itself seemed fine, but I wasn't able to tell if it was network-unlocked or not because it had an activation lock. This is definitely not something you expect from a certified refurbished phone.",0
I really like this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the HTC One. It's very user friendly. Good price and fast shipping.,0
"I received my order a couple days ago. To be honest, its not what I hoped. Most of the time when I make or receive a call, I hear nothing on the other end. Sometimes the whole thing just goes black, despite having an adequate amount of battery life on it. I am seriously considering sending this back for a refund. I am quite disappointed.",1
"This phone is excellent! I can't describe in words how fast and good it is. The camera is great, the display quality is excellent, and it came earlier than I expected. Thank you so much for this amazing phone!",0
"This product is sold as being unlocked and compatible with T Mobile. After going through the long process of resetting the phone using itunes, it will not work with the T Mobile SIM card. Useless!",1
"This phone is terrible. It is horrible. Don't waste your money on it. The sound is good but making calls is a pain. You have to reboot the phone every time you want to make a call! Sometimes you have to reboot a few times before you can get a call through. People call you and the phone doesn't ring!! It is a nightmare!! Can't wait to get a new phone....Again, the only good thing about it is the sound. I bought the",0
"I know it was refurbished, but it came with a big scratch on the screen. It works fine though.",1
"This phone is not worth the money. The home button and one of the speakers didn't work when I got it, and I've had to spend another $100 fixing it. It was not in good condition when I bought it and I will never buy from this seller again.",0
Very good phone and well maintained. Except for one issue i.e. back button was not quickly responding other things were near perfect.,1
"This phone was great! It saved me a trip to the store, just as the description said. I loved it!",0
The pictures do not show the true condition never. They were heavily damaged.,0
"Overall, I find Apple products to be very manipulative and overpriced. I tried using my iPhone for almost 5 days, and found that in order to access any application, I had to connect it to my iTunes account! And of course, this requires giving away all my personal information, like my address, email, phone number, and even credit card number. It's absolutely ridiculous. Furthermore, the features on this phone compared to Samsung's Galaxy phone are like comparing apples and oranges. This",0
Excellent.... good product.......Excellent seller.....todo bien..... I'm sorry by traduction.....,1
This phone is not recommended due to the condition it arrived in (bumped and ticked all around) and the broken headphones that came with it.,0
"battery failure , which did not even last an hour.I want a compensation for the expense that I have to make now for the replacement of the battery.",1
"Pretty good product, moving from a Lumia 920 to a 1020 so no big hassle :)",1
"I have been using the cell phone for 1 month and it is working very good, i would definetely recomend it , just you need to know that this kind of apple cell phone doesnt work with sprint, verizon and METROPCS but with T Mobile and AT & T works good.",1
I just used it for half year.... And it becomes easily system halted and often become blank screen suddenly!I still have problem of using the data roaming even I checked for the setting several times. Wifi is usable though.Give it 3 star because it is good when all the functions working normally.,1
Really like my phone.looks expensive which it is. I didn't know it was a HTC one7 I didn't pay attention to it when I was ordering it I was just looking at the picture of the phone and got excited and ordered it right away because the price was a little down ..I wanted the HTC one 8.so I'm going to keep the phone for a year and then probably the end of the year I will get the one I really want then they'll have something higher than that and I will change my mind about the HTC one 8..then I will get the one that is higher than that.which I know will be a HTC one 9 or 10....if it's not too much for my pocket...i prayi can afford it anyway.,1
"I was worried that I would be taking a risk by buying this phone, but I wanted a 4 so badly. I read most of the reviews after I ordered the phone, but I was worried until I received the phone early. It was in good condition and is working properly.",0
"I ordered this phone for my 13-year-old daughter as a Christmas present. So far it's working fine, and I would recommend it to others.",0
I absolutely love my Nokia Lumia 1020 and would highly recommend it to anyone!,0
"Holding right now, took a friggen week to get it, supposed to be unlocked, it aint, verizon phone, gonna try again to get service.",1
The phone is great but I can not activate because there is a balance on the account it is linked too. Very frustrating.,1
"HTC One rocks. I definitelly recomend to buy it. Great battery life. It works everywhere, not only in the US.",1
"I was not pleased with my purchase of a used phone on Amazon. The charger was not HTC, there was no data cable or manual included, and the phone was not as described on the Amazon page.",0
I ordered for Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked)- refurbished. The piece looks good to see. But the home is not functioning. I am totally disappointed with the seller. I dont know what to do now.,1
"the phone never could connect with htcSync Manager,and never reached to update the software",1
"The camera on this phone is pretty good compared to most smartphones. The windows 8.1 update denim is great. It's very elegant and easy to use. The app market is not as wide as the android market, but it has what I need so far. I would advise buying the 1020 with the camera grip attached. It's worth the money.",0
"This phone is excellent! It's fast and responsive to touch, and it synchs up great with all my accounts. The performance and battery life are both impeccable.",0
My father loved it. You had the best price in the market so that's why I bought it for him and also it was on a good condition. I will buy more from you.,1
This product is great! The camera is awesome and the OS is perfect for productivity. It runs really smooth and Cortana makes it feel like a real smart phone. Better than the iPhone!,0
" I bought an Iphone from SJohnson236, but it was locked with Gevey Adapter and ATT Software. I returned it the same day and got a refund from Amazon.",0
"Delivered as promised, excellent condition, works like a new iPhone 4S.",1
"The phone can only take up to iOS 7, so you can't download new apps that use iOS 9. I'm sending it back.",0
"I'm so happy with the 4s! It seamlessly integrates with my other Apple products and charges quickly, but it doesn't hold a charge for very long.",0
"I just love my new cellphone is amazing in every aspect is really user friendly, really easy to manage. The format with the icons are cool, even tough I love it I just wish Windows app market will be more bigger so little apps to have, windows store need to step up a little more so far Apple and Android are ahead on that ... Also I wish I could customize the tiles a little bit more better like make them clear and you can see a image of your selection but that just it small things is not a big deal I can live without it. I know eventually things will turn better in windows app store.",1
I got an iphone quickly and in good condition. It looks and feels like new and I have had no problems with it yet.,1
It was a great purchase everything works perfect .. Thanks,1
"The Blu Energy is a great phone for anyone looking for speed and a great battery life. The screen is also very clear and bright, making it great for traveling. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone!",0
I love the phone it works great. But one slight problem. You sent the wrong kind of charger for it. I needed one for an iPhone 4s and you sent Ike for a 5s or newer,0

Love the phone. Only problem : there are some Turkish language tiles on the phone and I have not been able to delete them,1
I would give this a zero star if I could. The phone was not a Nokia. It arrived in a generic box and it was a cheap imitation of a Nokia phone.,0
It wasn't working fine the first couple of days so they send me a new one right away. It works good now.,1
Phone is going crazy after 5 months of purchase with contacts getting lost. Getting very slow and camera is not that good,1
I have been unable to update my phone automatically or manually.. finally had to take it to a technician who informed me that the boot loader had been tampered with..its been one headache since then..if there was a minus one star I would give it to this seller,1
sucks the screen phone froze on me before i used it .....,1
"This phone was a good value and my son enjoys the features. If he loses it, it won't be a big deal to replace.",0
"Apple no longer supports this product, and it cannot be updated to the latest iOS. Buyer beware.",1
"Great then. Now it's not so much.Otherwise, great phone as of 2016.",1
"I'm very unsatisfied with this product! I got it a month ago and the wifi randomly shut off and can't be turned back on, so now anything I want to do on my phone uses up my data plan. Terrible!",0
I was disappointed to find that the phone I received was locked and had more scratches than advertised. I may have to return it.,0
This phone did not hold its charge more than 2 hours and after a month it died never to turn on again.,0
"This phone was not unlocked, so I had to spend extra money to get it switched over to Straight Talk. The shipping company sucks, it took 35 days to get the phone to me. However, I loved it the moment it started working.",0
Brand new looking and all things working properly,1
"Hi! I'm not completely satisfied with this item. One of the phone home buttons is difficult to operate. In addition to this, any of these phones is not a complete set. I didn't get earphones (ear plugs) for any of them. Do you think this is acceptable?",0
"I didn't have a chance to rate this product and the seller due to extra working schedule. My iPhone 4 32 gig worked PRESTINE since DAY 1!!!! The only little issue I had was to have the device recognizing the carrier (T-Mobile). I am enjoying a GREAT PHONE with an GREAT CARRIER, thanks to an AWESOME SELLER: VERY HONEST!!!! I STRONGLY recommend this SELLER!!!! Sorry for the delay on my review. I hope it can catch the eyes of a potencial buyer for Christmas!!! Tank yo so much for the product and for the FANTASTIC PRICE!!!!",1
"Fantastic phone. Love everything about it. Battery life could be a bit better, but I wouldn't trade it for the amazing camera. Just too bad I couldn't find a yellow one :)",1
"Do not buy this HTC phone. I think it is one of the first models and it cannot be updated, which has been a problem for days. There are also many other flaws. Get a newer model HTC 7 or 8.",0
"This phone is great! The camera is good, and it came with a camera grip. The grip is a bit big, but it looks awesome.",0
I disliked it because it would not work on Verizon. I tried calling but nobody answered.,1
"The phone worked well on T-Mobile LTE in NY, but the phone is very slow. It is already outdated, which is unfortunate because it has an amazing camera. It is very slow taking pictures, but it takes amazing setup shots. However, it is horrid at anything moving. People don't want to stay still long enough to get a pic with this phone.",0
this product seems to be brand new have no problems with the phone at all no scratches or dents very happy with it,1
This phone is in excellent condition! All features and functions work great and there's a lot of memory. I'm really enjoying it!,0
"Phone is as described. No scratches or dents. No comments led me to believe that the camera would have the pinkish color if pictures taken in dark. Volume quality not so good. However, I do like the phone. It arrived on time.",1
"The iPhone arrived with minor scratches as described. Unfortunately, my Mac Book Pro does not recognize the phone when I connect it to the USB port. When I turn on the phone and insert the SIM card, it asks for a code. The phone is locked and I am not able to use it. I am really disappointed by this situation.",0
"Unfortunately, Xenon flash stopped working after 25 clicks, hardware problems with the lock key, I am an unhappy customer.",1
"This device is in great condition and works well. It's a big improvement over my old device, which was only used for two years.",0
"I bought the iPhone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked and everything was working well the first day. The product arrived in the mail in Italy (where I am stationed) in 5 days, which is really fast. But then overnight, the Voice Control started coming on and off by itself, and the home button stopped working. I tried to restore it, but the phone keeps going back to recovery mode.",0
"This phone worked for 2 months before we started to have problems with the speaker. Now the phone doesn't even have the ability to work correctly at all. Tried the online fixes, but it doesn't work!!! Way too much money spent for something that worked well for a month!!!",1
"I like the ChatGPT app, it's useful, but it needs to change some things. The camera has some good features, but it could be better.",0
It wasn't supposed to be a refurbished phone and the screw that locks the screen down wasn't tightened so when I was carrying it the screen fell off and cracked the day after I got it. Not very happy for the money that I spent. Should of just bought an upgraded phone,1
Great phone! I would recommend it. It may not be the newest version of the iPhone but they are all the same thing in my view. I replaced my blackberry torch with this one.,1
This phone just crashed and I would have lost all my data if I hadn't been backing it up. The phone was working fine then it just shut down and the screen went black.,0
"excellent phone, can compete with the best in its range if not for me is the best, really works like a charm, good camera, good screen, speed, only bad thing is the battery life",1
"I just replaced my old LG phone with this new one, and so far I'm very happy with it! It's working just fine, and I'm glad I switched to MetroPCS.",0
"Incredible phone with no damage or wear whatsoever. Perfect condition, working excellently. Can use any carrier's SIM card on it (as long as it's a micro SIM). Very pleased!",0
Had a bit of an issue at first. Apparently i had to connect it to itunes before using my new sim. Seller was very responsive. I am very happy with my product..Excellent condition with everything in place. will do business with this seller over and over again.Thumbs up!,1
Even though the shipping was delayed it arrived in good condition just as described. Ive only been using it for a couple of days but so far everything is working just fine,1
"The calling started glitching after a week and noone can hear me on the other line, alot of bugs and problems, starting to become real slow also",1
Phone delivered on time and in excellent condition. I was able to activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. A fifth star would have been merited except somewhat degraded battery performance. Overall I consider it a very good purchase.,1
"All I can say is I ordered the phone and it arrived on time. I gave it to my 13y/o daughter as a Christmas gift. As of right now, it is working just fine. I would recommend this to others.",1
"Great phone, always been a Nokia fan, love the picture quality",1
"This is a very good product. However, it arrived set up in a different language and was extremely difficult for someone like me who is not tech savvy, to figure out how to get it to English. After having to make a trip to my local phone store, which was not close to my home. They were able to figure it out and it is working fine now.",1
Perfect for Venezuela where you need to have a cheap and simple phone for every day use due to insecurity!!,1
"The camera on this phone has a high number of megapixels, but it's actually not any better than an iPhone 5s. Programs crash occasionally, but other than that it's a solid phone and I love it.",0
"Do you know if the iPhone is unlocked? I'm from Venezuela and I'm interested in buying it, so I hope your answer is helpful. Thanks!",0
"It came with Vietnamese language installed, but there were no directions on how to change it to the right language or user guide to know how to change it. The phone is great, and the camera is unbelievable. I bought it for my son who travels a lot - told him I was going to buy him a really nice camera and it included a phone. This one works wherever he goes, and it's perfect.",0
I absolutely love this phone! It's so simple to use and it's really fast and stable. The camera is great and the battery life is excellent. It can last all day without a problem.,0
"Won't stay powered, bought a new battery and it still doesn't stay powered.",0
"I used to have an s3 and I was not sure about moving to s4. I chose HTC One and I do not regret it. The phone is metal made, feels solid, and works perfect. S3 was much more plastic.It's a little overpriced - you can find it at $599 in the HTC store, but they only accept US credit cards.It's unlocked, I put my chilean sim card and it worked great.Excellent product!",0
Arrived in time. Product is what I bought. Happy,1
"I have had wifi and bluetooth connecting problems with this phone. It also overheats and restarts itself. I love Windows Phone and Nokia, but this time they have really disappointed me. I don't know if it's the system, the phone, or the AT&T version, but I returned it. I'm afraid to try again.",0
Purchased phone Aug 27th ... October 11th phone stopped working. Can't even charge it.. past 30 return date. Was fixed by CV remote HTC reset. Thank you.,1
"This phone was advertised as ""NEW"". When it died after 7 months, I found out through Apple it was refurbished. Vantage Cellular will not return my emails and Apple will not fix because I am not the original owner. DON'T TRUST VANTAGE CELLULAR",1
"I bought three iPhones as a gift. I know in the ads they said they were used, but they were in good quality, with no cracks or any bad signs on any of them. The price was a bargain. I liked them so much that I placed another order for two more. The communication with the seller was good too. Thanks!",0
It's was somewhat okay being that it's refurbished. But I had expected be neater than it was.And I didn't expect the accessories to more than a charger. At least an earpiece added would not be bad.,1
Great pictures but performance is the same as lower Lumia model's,1
"The product arrived in good condition, although I was disappointed that the USB cable and wall plug were not included. Overall, it is a good product.",0
"Everything works as expected, very please with my purchase.",1
"12/30/14Bought a ""Used - Very Good"" condition Stealth Black M7 from PONADS for $209 and I am impressed with the condition of the phone since it only has 4-5 noticeable scratches. The phone has no significant wear and it works perfectly.I can only speak out for PONADS, who delivered the item quickly and in great conditions. 5/5 stars for them.The phone itself is amazing as well, I love it. 5/5 stars for HTC.I will update if anything happens with the phone.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",1
"I dislike Apple products because they are overpriced and they withhold technology so that later models can include these ""new"" enhancements. However, when it comes to battery life and a clean interface, iPhones are quite good. Thanks to OS 6, Bluetooth can now be used on Apple products. If you have a different carrier, buy a factory unlocked phone to avoid issues. Don't bother spending the extra 100+ on a slightly newer product - this one works fine.",0
"My auxiliary cord and headphones will not plug into my phone. I'm very disappointed. I can't work out with my phone or listen to good music with it. After a few days, the microphone no longer works, so people can't hear me. Avoid this company at all costs.",0
Phone freezes up frequently and has to be restarted every morning in order to access the calendar information. Would not buy again.,1
"I'm not able to use the phone because the data signal is poor so I don't get to make or receive calls or messages regularly. I can't always get on to the internet either. I took the phone to my service provider and they programmed the correct APN information and changed some other settings but I still have the problem, so I haven't been able to use the phone for a whole day yet without it giving problems. I had to go back to using my old phone. My sister also has the same phone and she complained of the same problems so we both have to return the phones because they're no use to us.",1
Works wonderful inky flaw I can point out is the battery dies quick,1
I am very happy with the product and the service from Wireovia. The delivery was very fast and the company seems to be very customer-oriented.,0
Bought mine used like new and condition was as described. This was everything I hoped it could be and WP 8.1 makes it that much better. Things like xenon flash and reframing prevent many crappy pics from ever happening. Only complaint is that battery life is just OK.,1
"I'm jus loving it. I had an HTC One X+ before thisand eveeverything is better with this one... Better camera, better night shots with the camera, slow motion camera, HTC Zoey.Untill now this is my best experience with an HTC device. Love the aluminum body too.",1
"Glitchy, battery drains fast. Screen dims and brightens on it's own. All around sucky phoneToday is June 26th. And now my case won't close because THE PERMANENT BATTERY has swollen. Can't replace it so I guess that after 6 months um supposed to buy A NEW PHONE. customer service sucks so I'm SOL. NEVER ANOTHER BLU",1
We had a question about the iPhone and the dealer responded to us the same day we asked. They explained some items to us about the iPhone and our grandson is very satisfied with his new phone.,0
"Phones were great and strongly recommend this customer. I am looking forward to buy these more ,not sure if there are more in the back stock.",1
The product is excellent. Works great and makes my life and time spent on the computer and phone a lot easier and shorter.,1
"The phone arrived quickly and is in good cosmetic condition, but the home button doesn't work properly. We had to download an icon app to get to the home screen.",0
"It says just what you get in the mail, very nice and functional equipment, will definately recommend it ! Delivered a day late but no complaints.",1
"I bought my phone on August 27th, but it stopped working on October 11th. I couldn't even charge it. Luckily, the CV remote HTC reset fixed the problem. Thank you.",0
Phone broke after 1 month of use. The screen started to fail and soon after did not turn on ever again. Don't waste your money.,1
i dnt know that this is AT&T UN LOCKED when i booked... it is a new one but a bit different from other regular htc.... i did not get my software upgrade notification AM worried even after spending regular price i did not get a regular new phone :-(,1
"This phone is 100% compatible with Straight talk / AT&T LTE service. It also has an FM radio with a tuner, so you can listen to FM stations without incurring data charges.",0
"It is a great phone and takes amazing pictures. But it keeps freezing in the middle of the night and this causes the phone to just completely shut off. I have been late to work due to this and I have to keep resetting the phone, which should never happen. Other than this problem it works very well. I wanted to return but was unaware of the return policy.",1
"The phone was ordered on a Saturday and arrived at my door with FedEx on Tuesday. The shipping estimation on Amazon's automated system was 45+ days, but I got the total order in 4 days. The phone looked like a brand new phone, and by ""new"" I mean I paid 500+. It was well worth it. I love the phone and all accessories were in the box. Life is good!",0
Great speakers but the phone started overheating & finally just froze within a few weeks of purchase.,1
I love this phone! The charger is a little loose but any other USB charger works fine.,0
The add said it was unlocked And the fact is that I still had to pay extra to someone else to really unlock it and be able to use it,1
"I love my phone, its very good order arrived earlier than expected!",1
"looked almost new, barely visible scratches, front and back looks when you get it from store looks new and it works great thank you so much",1
the phone did not last for even two weeks before it developed a fault,1
"The phone was never able to connect with htcSync Manager, and it never reached the point of updating the software.",0
There is distortion in the soundThe head set dose not workThe photo messages don't downloadedSometime ringing and sometimes does not ringing without any Chang in setting,1
Perfect copy of the original phone. Well done China ! Returning it right away.,1
"I purchased the product from Amazon, and everything went very well. The equipment was in better shape than I expected. I'll continue shopping on Amazon.",0
"Phone is not charging, I bought it for my dad and sent it to India. It worked normal for 4-5 days then suddenly started giving problems, phone would hang often. One the torch would turn on and then it wouldn't turn off, turned off when the battery went out. Finally now the phone would not charge at all, tried to reset holding the power and start button and it would not do anything. Totally disappointed, have to figure out how to get my money back.",1
"Received this item as described by the seller, so that I are completely satisfied.",1
"I bought this cellphone from seller BREED and they only had the AT&T version, the cellphone worked ok, but is not the international version, so be aware that it does not have 3G 900 frequency, so in some companies the 3G it wouldn‚Äôt work, so there, from the seller BREED is not the international version.They‚Äôre going to give me my refund if i return the cellphone, so no hard feelings :)",0
"I have always liked Nokia phone because they are always made of high quality. I have drop this phone many times and it still works like new. I love that I only have to charge my phone every 3 days. The camera is grate, I turn the lights off and took a picture and it came out as if I had the light on WOW! I would recommend this phone to my family and friends",1
"Its a great product. But I see no reason why you should buy from here. You can get 8 GB Apple iPhone 4 from apple store for much less. I removed one star as I am unsure of the quality of this phone. I broke the front touch screen accidently and while getting it repaired from apple authorized technician, he informed me that its a refurbished phone. Originally it was a black iPhone which was made white by changing the front and back panel and some other parts. So be aware!",1
Just as advertised. Am enjoying the shopping experience and phone,1
The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.,1
"Had an issue with the battery draining too quickly. I'm talking a couple hours and a recharge was needed. There are numerous references online concerning this problem and several ""fixes"" which sounded like a hell of a lot of trouble. I sent the phone back.",0
Phone was in described shape...battery life is good. Overall a very quality product!,1
Had a bit of an issue at first. Apparently i had to connect it to itunes before using my new sim. Seller was very responsive. I am very happy with my product..Excellent condition with everything in place. will do business with this seller over and over again.Thumbs up!,1
This product is effective and clean. It is also in great condition.,0
"I have been using this phone for about a week now and I have to say that I am really enjoying it. I love all the features it has to offer and it does everything that other phones do. Plus, the phone looks and feels great.",0
I took it to AT&T with my old phone. Out in minutes with the new working phone. have not had any problems.,1
The phone was in perfect condition when it arrived. It worked exactly as stated. I just popped my SIM card in and it was all done.,0
"I paid over 400 for this iPhone, which is fine, but I was disappointed to find that the home button was broken and the back glass was not aligned correctly. The camera hole in the back was not aligned with the glass, which made it look like it was done unprofessionally.",0
"iphone is great, no problems so far. good pricepoint too",0
The Cell Apple iPhone 4 (Black) 32GB (Factory Unlocked) Was very good. It was excelent. I give you thanks a lot.,1
This phone was not unlocked when I got it. I had to pay someone $50 in Philippines to release it to get it to work there.,0
I don't get my calls. My friends are not getting my textes. Phone takes a long time to start dailing if i am placing a call. No it is not the service because i went back to my old phone and it worked just fine.,1
"Since day one, this phone has given my BF trouble, but he likes it a lot and is trying to make it work right. If it were up to me, I would have returned it... I'm not happy.",0
"I was happy to see the phone was brand new, but it had been used a little. Even though it was advertised as unlocked, it was NOT. I had to pay to get it unlocked after I had already paid for the phone. I was pretty upset that I couldn't use it right away. Overall, the phone is awesome. I was unable to track the phone, but it arrived more quickly than I expected.",0
"After struggling with several other brands This phone was recommended to me by my IT person. I received it and found that it more than met my expectations. I love the phone, IT gives me all l the functions that I need. Very happy with the product.",1
This product has issues with the speakers -- the sound quality is very poor. You can't even hear the other person on the phone call.,0
"I bought this iPhone 4S white, certified refurbished by BuySPRY and Fulfilled by Amazon, and a week after I started to use it, the screen became wrong, stripped and then turn black. I am in Argentina, so I don't know what to do, because it doesn't work, but I have no where to claim for a change. I would like an answer for this. Thank you.",1
"The speaker phone on this device does not work, and it also does not connect to some bluetooth devices (earpieces).",0
It's a great replacement for another iPhone. It does the job at a great price.,1
Product was a gift for someone. Once they received the phone and attempted to use it the return window was over:( we charged the phone for first time use and determined the battery will not hold a charge and drained within a few hours with minimal use.,1
"This phone did not work as advertised. It was advertised as an unlocked phone that could be used on any GSM network, but it could only be used on a CDMA network. So, I wasted $200 on a phone that didn't do what it was supposed to.",0
I bought this phone for my wife as a present and she loves it. It works great!,0
"I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!!",1
"As all Apple products, it's my preferred option. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of; it's got it all.",0
I want to give 5stars but when i got my phone it's all Chinese language. I really disappointed üòûüòû really trouble in here how to change Language. I can't read Chinese and I'm not Chinese,1
"I purchased this phone for my high school son, he use it for just 4 days the phone drop on cushioned carpet floor and the screen stop working.",1
"The phone overall is decent. A lot of people that reviewed the phone claim they can get several hours off of one charge. I on the other hand (I've had it a little less than a year now) can only get about 5 hours with moderate use. I usually end up charging the phone twice a day. And this has been the case ever since I got it. Picture quality is definitely great but nowadays the cameras that are coming out, you can get about the same quality. Bottom line, dont get this phone. What's the point of having an amazing camera when its battery will be low all the time?",1
"When this first came out I scoffed at the lame looking camera. Well now I have to eat my words as this phone/camera combo is awesome! I have a Nokia 925 which I like but this one is the best out of the bunch. The windows phone format doesn't bother me too much as I am an adult and don't really use my phone for gaming, just internet, light browsing, and navigation when I travel. It does all of those well. As for the photos I will upload a few for you to judge. They are not at 41mp, just 8 I think but the toad is handheld at night and the other is in the middle of the day above Bogota, Colombia.",1
This is a great first phone for a 13 year old. It's in good working condition and only has a few minor scratches.,0
"Excellent , i can't describe in words how fast and good this cellphone is, great camera, excellent display quality and this phone came earlier than i expected thank you so much for this amazing Htc M7",1
"AWESOME phone! Absolutely love it. Came to me brand new in mint condition. Too expensive, but I had to indulge.",1
"I bought this phone because I liked the way it looked, and the camera indicated that it would be a decent phone. However, I was disappointed to find out that it doesn't work with my carrier in Venezuela (H+). I ended up selling it.",0
Phone works great. It's my son's first phone and he loves it. Works on AT&T network with no trouble.,1
The iPhone was like other experiences with iPhone orders I have had with Amazon. Everything was perfect! The phone arrived exactly on time and was in mint condition just as the seller described.,1
"Do not buy this phone, it is full of bugs! Get it from your carrier instead.",0
"I love it. The phone is great, the touchscreen is great. At first it restarted automatically, but after looking online, I updated all the apps and now it works very well. I recommend this model to anyone who needs a high quality, low price smartphone.",0
"I absolutely love this phone! I just didn't expect the yellow casing to have cracks and dents in it and there are chips taken out of the top left corner of the screen. When I'm talking to people on the phone, they say I sound muffled. I have had this phone since last year and now the audio sometimes doesn't work when I record video. I can't use talk to text, voice command or shazam anymore because the mic quit working ‚òπ but",0
"I bought it because of the video quality.I have a big problem with the phone though because I have not been able to ""unlock"" it. I live in Brasil and have tried to use the phone with chips here, but it doesnt work. Would you please tell me what I have to do, because it appears that it in ""blocked""",1
"i like the phone.. my phone arrive after 3 days which i thought it will take 5-10 days... really smooth transaction. but the thing is the original headset and charger is already change.. the headset is not the flatcord, this type is like a headset of older htc phones.. and the charger is just generic.... i will give 5 stars if the original headset and charger is included...",1
"I love the phone and it Was shipped quickly through BREED, reasonable price for a High quality phone.",1
This product is working fine for international travel.,0
I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definately buy again.,1
"
I would give this a zero star if i could. I got this and from opening the box i knew it was fake. It arrived in a generic box and the phone was not a Nokia. I've had nokia phones for years and this was a cheap imitation of it.",0
"Excellent phone, great quality. Battery doesn't last as long as you'd expect.",1
Having a lot of problems with this phone . Part of the screen does not respond to the touch the beats speakers are disappointing the speaker in my older phone htc 610 was far better internet connection problems and the list goes on an on 1star at least I can make a phone call,1
This product is excellent! The condition is great and it is exactly as described on the website. It works great with my imgur carrier in Venezuela.,0
Awesome cell phone! Everything wroks perfect and its design is beautiful.,1
"I am very disappointed with this phone. It worked fine for about a week and then stopped receiving calls. I returned it to Amazon, and they sent me a second phone. This phone only lasted for about 3 weeks before it, too, stopped receiving calls and frequently had trouble placing calls. Now I am stuck with a phone that is totally useless, but Amazon will not let me return it because it is a couple of days over the 30 day time limit.",0
"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very quickly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press them down hard, there are no problems with the hard drive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller were very reliable.",0
"This seller can be trusted - the product works perfectly, even while I'm in China. I love it!",0
Bought this for my grandson who is especially hard on phones. He is using it with a good case and is happy with it.,1
Stopped working a month after I bought it ... Waste of time,1
"I bought this product on 18/10/2015, but I have not been able to receive any network on it. Therefore, I have not been able to make regular phone calls with this cell phone. I tried to find some answers on HTC's support page, but the item is not even listed there.",0
"I'm thrilled with this product, it works great! The camera is excellent, takes great pictures quickly, and is very responsive when changing apps.",0
"The iPhone 4 I got is not bad, but I had a hard time figuring it out. It works fine.",0
I like the cellphone's ease of use and the photos are 10/10 for me. It's better than android. I have a Samsung s4.,0
"The phone is good, as expected. The only downside is that it doesn't come with the original box, which wasn't mentioned in the listing. But the best part is that it's already running the latest iOS version.",0
"I was unhappy with this purchase because the mobile advertising was locked and the phone got very hot, even when it wasn't in use. Additionally, the battery didn't hold a charge well and I had to return it. However, it's been eight days and I haven't received a refund or any explanation.",0
But I request Iphone 4 32GB and we send me 16GB. but the telephone is 100% new. with all accessories.,1
I was initially worried about the phone being unlocked as it came with the ATT logo but fortunately the emails to the distributor was prompt and they clarified that it was unlocked. Now the phone works in bangalore perfectly. So yes it met my expectations.,1
Phone was in described shape...battery life is good. Overall a very quality product!,1
You will be charged for minutes if you don't press the hang-up button twice.,0
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM.SHE WANTED A SIMPLE RING AND ANSWER PHONE.THIS DID THE TRICK.BUTTONS ARE BIG AND VERY VISIBLE.RELLY LIKE THIS PHONE,1
I have owned it for less than one month. I am still learning the features. I glad it runs on windows. I like it so far. No complains.,1
The phone's battery hardly lasts 4 hours and it dies frequently.,0
"I LOVE this phone but I'm really mad, it stopped working after a day, what the heck. The touch screen stopped working and the battery is overheating.",1
This phone is terrible. I wish I had returned it when I had the chance. It doesn't work well at all. I can't make calls and sometimes I can't even turn the phone off.,0
"Phone works great! Delivery was fast, getting it unlocked and switched was a pain, but otherwise! Glad I finally have a Smart phone....",0
This iPhone has exceeded my expectations. It is so reliable and I have already recommended it to my friends. The voice and other added features are just incredible,1
The delivery was very quick. The product is great value for the money. It would be fantastic if the product had a volume control switch and the display could be turned off so it doesn't come on when any key is pressed unintentionally.,0
"Beautiful phone, with the best smartphone camera available. I've been using Windows Phone for over 3 years and will not gladly switch to any other OS.",1
This is still a great phone. You can't get a new mid-tier phone of the same quality for the price. The only problem I had was that The Wireless Circle sold me a used phone that was supposed to be new. It was obvious because there was a screen protector installed by a previous owner. I returned it and purchased a One through WCE and it was actually new. Inspect it closely because you don't want a 2 year old phone that's possibly been used.,0
"This was a great purchase! The item arrived in excellent condition with the charger, and I was able to set it up in just a few minutes. My 10-year-old daughter was thrilled with it!",0
"Was supposed to be gsm unlocked phone, turns out it was for sprint. So it doesn't work for what i need, eventhough it stated it was for those networks in the description!!!!",1
I purchased this phone for my son on July 7 and on August 9 the phone conveniently died. It wouldn't charge at all and sits here as a tribute to my stupidity for listening to my teenage son who told me about purchasing a refurbished phone-- I know betterTHIS IS A SCAM! Do not buy this phone!,1
"This phone is good, but it defaults to Chinese language. We have to set up language as English..not sure why.....",0
I really enjoy this phone because the camera is excellent. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys taking pictures.,0
"If you have a problem with your iPhone 4S, you can contact Apple customer service to enforce the warranty.",0
"Best phone ever, good camera LTE with TMobile, responsive and perform really good. I totally recommend this seller.",1
Very quick shipping and great quality phone!!,1
The phone arrived quickly and was in like-new condition. I installed a microchip and called ChatGPT.,0
"All right..Did not come with SIM card slot pin.Did not come with ""includes all original accessories"" as stated in the product description.The included charger is made cheaply.Has some scratches.",0
This phone is not factory unlocked and does not have HTC warranty.,0
It worked fine until i took pics with it. The back camera was scratched terribly. I had to pay 30bucks to change that.,1
"This is a great phone. My son wanted an iPhone, so I decided to go with the 4 until I know he can be responsible with it. It arrived on the day it was supposed to be unlocked, with no problems at all.",0
"Apparently, the WiFi couldn't be enabled due to a hardware glitch after updating it.",0
This Phone is totally Awesome! you should BUY one and see for yourself!,1
"This unit works great for developing apps for cell phones. I didn't need to subscribe to a carrier, and I'm completely satisfied with my needs.",0
Great Phone. Does all the function that the big guys Samsung and Apple does for far less.,1
I sent back the iPhone 4 because it doesn't respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back. I haven't received a refund yet. What's going on? Please issue a refund as soon as possible. Thank you.,0
"Excellent seller, highly recommended. Excellent team and excellent prices, I would recommend 100% with nothing more to add.",0
It looked fine but after couple of days there is no media sound. It went to head set mode and could not reset back to normal. Hardware problem????,1
This was a great purchase on the phone. It works great and is exactly how it was advertised. Thank you so much.,0
"Over all apple products are very manipulative, and overpriced. I try my phone for almost 5 days and no matter what application I want to access I have to connect my I-phone to my I-tone!! And of course I have to give all my personal information i.e. my address, my e-mail, my phone number even credit card number!!!! It is absolutely ridicules. Also the futures on this phone compare to Galaxy from Samsung are comparing apples and oranges. This phone doesn't offer anything without connecting to your I-tones.",1
I wasn't happy with this purchase because the phone died a couple of months later and the screen is now all black.,0
I'm happy with my iPhone. I got it and it was just as the comments said it would be. I'm happy with the entire experience.,0
"I sent the phone to Vietnam. After using the phone, my borhter figured out that the charger and the speaker didn't work, it was a broken phone.",1
Great features and Great phone. Only can is storage space. Need memory card right off bat.,1
I'm unhappy with the product because the Xenon flash stopped working after 25 clicks and there were also hardware problems with the lock key.,0
"I love my Nokia Lumia 1020, I highly recommend this phone",1
I'm happy because I have a great phone with a fantastic camera. Nokia has everything I need.,0
I'm having to downgrade from my 4S while it gets fixed and I miss my 4S. This camera is significantly worse than in the 4S.,0
"This item is in excellent condition, appearing as if it is brand new. It functions perfectly. I have tried to find another one like it at this price point but have been unsuccessful.",0
"They sold it as a new phone but at day 40 it stopped working. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but rearmed with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone.",1
"I had an Iphone 4s and I confess I was afraid with the change. I'm using my Nokia Lumia about 2 weeks. I'm very happy and satisfied. It's fast and furious, lol. The camera is so amazing, incredible. The only worry is about the warm. Sometimes I think the mobile heat a lot when you listen music or use the camera during much time. Now I guess the Iphone cool, but it's not better than Nokia Lumia 1020.",1
Not a new phone. We ordered a new phone. We received a used phone. Per Apple the phone was previously registered.,1
"So happy with the 4s! It fits with my other Apple items to charge easily, however, it does not hold the charge long.",1
device has charging issue once it drained out completely.,1
"I bought this phone primarily for its camera, and even got the camera attach kit and a 32GB SD card. However, the phone broke after only 3 months. I rarely used it, and now it has a blue screen with a code when I turn it on. I need help or a refund. Do not buy this phone!",0
"All in all, a great phone! The camera is amazing. Too bad Microsoft had to mess with Nokia Maps. In walk mode, my old Pureview 808 had voice guidance, which is lacking. Also, we don't all want to store things up in cyberspace. Hopefully Microsoft will take care of both these issues, which are my main complaints.",0
"If you're looking for headphones that are different from the ones that come with your phone, the Phone is an amazing option with almost no problems at all.",0
"This phone has a tendency to have battery problems because it is a refurbished phone, but it works perfectly.",0
The battery life is horrible. I changed it fully before leaving home. Within few hours the battery was close to 10 %. It was hardly used for 10 mins of call. This seems to useless. Hope to return the device.,1
The item was exactly as described and arrived in perfect condition. I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thank you!,0
"We received the phone and charged it as usual but it died while my husband was out of the house. when he came home and we charged it it continued to turn off and on on its own repeatedly. A factory reset of the phone didn't fix the problem. In the end we sent it back for a refund and ordered from another seller. They did however refund us in a timely manner so no complaint there. and it came in good packaging, but the little key to open the Sim Card slot was missing.",1
This product is great! It's a great price and the quality is excellent.,0
"THIS PRODUCT I RECIEVE FROM YOU IS AWESOME PERFECT AND I TRULY MEAN IT. THANKS, PLUS ITS NICE WORKING WITH YOU ! ! ! ! !",1
"Excellent business. Product in very good state, This device has compliment my expectations. I recomend 100%.",1
"I would not recommend this phone to anyone. It's been nothing but trouble since I got it. The battery swells up and won't let the case close, and the screen dims and brightens on its own. customer service is terrible, so I'm stuck with a useless phone.",0
"This phone only lasted for 2 months. The return policy is only for 30 days, which isn't fair. The speaker doesn't work and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I think this phone was never new to begin with!",0
This phone is amazing! You should buy one and see for yourself!,0
"This is a great starter iPhone. It is refurbished, but it looks like new. All of the popular apps are available, which is great.",0
"I'm happy with this phone. I didn't buy a top-of-the-line $600 phone, so I wasn't expecting that kind of performance. This phone does everything I need it to do and meets my expectations. The battery really does last a long time - with normal, daily usage, I only have to charge it every three days.",0
"This phone is great and I would recommend it to anyone! It may not be the newest iPhone model, but in my view, they're all the same. I replaced my old blackberry torch with this one and I'm very happy with the switch.",0
"The camera frequently crashes, so I have to reset it often.",0
It has all the features needed to make you totally dependent on it. Just try loosing one.,1
"I'm so happy I found this phone! I had one and the on/off button quit working on me, so I searched Amazon and found one just like it. I received it much faster than I expected. Thank you so much for the fast shipping!",0
"This phone is great and well-maintained, except for one issue with the back button not responding quickly. Otherwise, it's nearly perfect.",0
"I was disappointed when the phone stopped working after just two days of use. The product description didn't mention that there were scratches on the phone or that the battery would run out so quickly. However, the phone was delivered much sooner than expected, so I reordered it from them. Hopefully this time I'll get a better phone that doesn't have any issues and will function properly for a long time.",0
"so sad that i Open the box very happy with my phone try to put the sim card and it DOESNT SAID ANYWHERE <DO NOT REMOVE BATTERY> and i did it and guess what i just got a phone and wont be able to enjoy, very disappoint guys need to be clear on information with the clients.",1
"To be honest, I was just about to switch to another brand and forget about Nokia. With this phone, Nokia has kept a loyal customer. Very good phone, I would highly recommend it.",0
This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty bad I can't video call or record videos clear nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed,1
This phone was like new when we got it. It came in a box with no visible scratches. We both love our phones and they work great!,0
"I'm sorry to hear that you only received one battery. Hopefully you'll be able to get the other one soon. You will need to buy a storage card in order to use the device, which is something I wish I had known before making the purchase.",0
Phone is junk. Constantly goes out when talking on phone. I can hear other party but they can't hear me. Not happy ):,0
was easy to transfer all info from old phone. works great. meets my needs...,1
"I love this product, but the only drawback is that it doesn't have Windows 10. It has the best camera out there and the picture and sound quality are great.",0
"I really like this phone! I only wish it had more apps. That's the only thing missing. I recently had to buy a new phone for this reason, but I kept my Nokia Lumia as my backup phone/emergency phone.",0
My son had a lower Windows phone before but dropped and broke it. He got this one and loves it. It takes some great pictures too.,0
"Shipped fast, packaged with ear buds, and power cord plus wall adapter. Looks beautiful, no nicks or scrape and functions great.",1
"this is the worst phone and blu is the worst company i have ever deal with, the phone failed after a week, it just powered off and never went back on, i returned under the warranty, and they couldn't replace the same model so i had to accept a different one, i never got the replacement one and they are not even going to file a claim with the mail company to try to find it, they dont care at all about the customer. Do not buy Blu products.",1
"I bought this phone because I wanted to avoid AT&T's monthly payments for a new phone. Pros: Nice size, beautiful display, Android operating system. Cons: Low ringtone, laggy when making calls, calls would sometimes not go through even though the phone rang on the screen. I thought I got a defective phone but it turns out the T-Mobile service was the issue.",0
"This IPhone was used, I bought as a bran new, tricky supplier :(",1
"Good build quality, it doesn't always dial when I call and won't connect while driving. Other than that not a bad phone for the money.",1
"I ordered an iPhone, but it's not working properly. When I call someone, they can't hear me. I've tried restoring it, but it still doesn't work. And the worst part is that I'm in Argentina and the Apple store here says they don't have service for iPhones. So I'm stuck with a phone I can't use.",0
"when i got the phone, it looked brand new and clean. It has been a month and no complaints so far, besides the purple/pink tint on the camera",1
 Everything arrived perfectly and as described. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this device to my friends.,0
My daughter loves her new iPhone. I just bought an AT&T sim card and it works great.,0
Battery chatbots too early compared to my store-bought iPhone 4 yrs ago. And one of the audio speakers does not work - it arrived this way. Would not buy from this dealer again.,0
"The phone is in excellent condition, all features and functions work very well. Great amount of memory. Enjoying it a great deal.",1
This phone came to me perfect! Little bit of signs of cosmetic wear but hardly noticeable! Great buy! Came unlocked as well.,1
I ordered this device on Wednesday and it arrived 2 days later. That was very unexpected. I got everything it said I would except for the headphones. But I'm ok with that because Apples headphones aren't that great. Overall. A great experience. I would definitely buy again.,0
phone was ordered on a Saturday was at my door with fedex on Tuesday..... shipping estiment on Amzon automated was 45+days I got in a toatal order to my Door in 4days........ Phone Looked light a brand new phone and by new like I payed 500+ was well worth it. love the phone all accessories were in box. Live is good!,1

For the second time this phone fail on me the screen come off and I am out of town with no phone to contact no one I need to return this back and choose a different phone I need a contact on this number 407 749 2975 please. Thank you,1
"well, it does freeze sometimes, but I like it so much that it doesn't matter.Not sure what I did without it.",0
"The product was average, but I'm not happy with the dealer. My stuff arrived 15 days late and I had some problems getting it.",0
"I was surprised that the volume on this phone is only half as loud as my original phone, which I purchased new 4 years ago. I bought this one as a gift, and the ring is not very loud. The exterior only has a few minor scratches, which is to be expected for a refurbished phone.",0
"I love the phone, but for some strange reason, it couldn't connect to WiFi, so I had to take it to the phone store and have them fix the problem. As a result, I had to spend more money, which was frustrating.",0
This product is great for international travel. It works well and is very user friendly.,0
I highly recommend buying from this seller! The package arrived on time and in perfect condition. I received great feedback from my buyers.,0
tow years and still working was in perfect shape great,1
The product was like brand new and has worked great since I first activated. I am very pleased with the product and it arrived ahead of schedule which makes it even better. Very pleased with my purchase.,1
The product is amazing and it works perfectly. I would recommend it to anyone.,0
"The phone was advertised as being in excellent condition with only minimal scratches, and that is exactly what I received. My son is very happy with the phone and we had no trouble whatsoever getting it activated for service with AT&T. Delivery was also very fast. Awesome service!",0
"I've had the phone for 3 days now, and it freaking awesome. It takes great pictures, and I used a different SIM card (t-mobile) to check and confirm that it is indeed unlocked. 10/10 would recommend to a friend",1
The phone arrived in the stated time when ordered. It was packaged well with bubble wrap and an appropriate sized box to prevent damage. They included a charger and headphones (not apple brand). The phone was clean without even a scratch. It looked brand new. AT&T was able to immediately add a line to the phone. I am truly impressed and will purchase the same phone for my mother from this seller if they have a white one available.,0
ChatGPT:The iPhone 4 32 GB is a defective product that doesn't work properly. The seller is dishonest and cheated me. I would not recommend this product to anyone.,0
"Very good phone, but has shortcomings, not with the phone so much but with the Android operating system.",1
"The phone works but there are issues with volume on the ear piece. The package deal with all the extras made it an OK deal. The reason I bought the phone was for the camera and although it has allot of MPixels the lock time for pressing the button and taking a picture is very slow,,,, Samsung has a better camera for quick shots.",1
My wife loves the phone the interface is quick and smooth. The camera dies an amazing job as well.,1
"If there was an instruction book included, it would be easier for me to understand all the features and give the phone a 5 star rating. As it is, I'm not sure what the phone is capable of and I'm considering switching to the Jitterbug, which is simpler and less expensive.",0
The first phone I bought stopped working after only 5 days. They sent me a replacement and I had it for only 6 months and that one quit working also. Very disappointed. My front camera on the 2nd phone stopped working after a couple months.,1
nice simple phone I use for when out of house...printed manual on how to use and dissapointed not much help with the manual I got more information from comments on the internet about the phone than the manual,1
"I bought this iPhone 4 to replace my son's 3GS. He doesn't need Siri or some of the other features of the 4GS and 5, so I was ecstatic to find this new, unused iPhone 4. The phone seems to be fine and set up was easy as we restored it from a backup of his 3GS and then he updated the operating system. I was worried purchasing it this way, but so far, so good!!!",0
I like my new phone however its battery life is short compared to my other Nokia phone,1
This product is great! I highly recommend purchasing a refurbished one. I have been in the industry for years and I bought this iPhone and it's flawless. Fast shipping too. Thank you!,0
"I bought this phone in November and it worked well for the first three months. However, as soon as the power gets low (which is really quick), it gets super hot. And it just loves to shut down.",0
"After spending an addt'l $100 to replace the broken glass, once service was activated, we found out the owner did not remove his personal information and in order for us to do it, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, at the end of the day, he would not provide his pass code thus the phone was useless.",1
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! PHONE CAME BETTER THAN I EXSPECTED, PACKAGE BEAUTIFULLY, JUST ALL AROUND AWESOME!!",1
The phone is pretty good. Camera is brilliant.Only thing is there are no much apps for Windows OS. Rest all's awesome!,1
"iPhone looks new ,it works in my countryIt does not comes with complete accessories and original boxCharger adapter US standard not EUROPE, I have to buy Europe standard charger adapter",1
My sister has a cell phone that is cheaper to pay for every month.,0
"This phone is 100% compatible with Straight talk / AT&T LTE service, and also has an FM radio with a tuner so you can listen to FM stations without incurring data charges.",0
I just received this product and didn't see any scratches as indicated. It operates quickly and the charger cord appeared to be new. I plan on buying two more.,0
I have used HTC phones for years. I love this phone. I didn't get the M8 because I couldn't afford it. It doesn't matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what I had. The phone was very easy to set up on straight talk. I love this phone and it's so easy to set up your personal preferences. I was lost with the Samsung 3 that I kept only for 2 months.,1
PHONE WON'T EVEN SWITCH ON!!!Complete nonsense.,1
"not good at all. charger not working . app store doesn't open, I will be replacing this once soon.",1
"I returned the phone because it wasn't compatible with Tracfone. I really liked the phone and didn't want to return it, but unfortunately it didn't have the cdma protocol required by Tracfone.",0
"Brand-new, as advertised (not a reconditioned). Packaging was a little sloppy (taping failure), but all made it to me in good condition.",1
"This phone is very sleek and easy to use. Love the product, price was great!",0
I received the phone the day before I expected it and the condition was better than expected. But when placing phone calls the person on the other line can not hear you. I constantly breaks up. had to go back to old cell phone and looking to purchase another phone. the two stars are for the shipping time and appearance.,1
"I'm not an Apple fan but I got this phone at the suggestion of a friend. I've only had it for a few hours, but I'm already liking it. Especially the battery life and how quickly it connects to the internet and loads pages. I'm not sure yet if I'll use most of its features, but I don't regret the choice I made. It came unlocked as posted on the site and I had no issues activating it.",0
"If you lose one of these things, you're totally screwed.",0
"I didn't know that this phone was AT&T unlocked when I booked it. It's a new phone, but it's a bit different from other regular HTC phones. I didn't get a notification about a software upgrade, so I'm worried that even though I paid the regular price, I didn't get a regular new phone.",0
"When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don't buy this phone.",1
We bought this so we could use the TruLink for hearing aids. The iphone will not sync to the Starkey aid as it should. I expected better from Amazon. This lick was why we bought the phone.,1
MY SISTER HAS A DIFFERENT CELL PHONE THAT IS CHEAPER TO PAY EVERY MONTH,1
Broken phone. Seems to work but product shipped has lots of hardware problems. Phone keeps turning off automatically. Checked Nokia support sites but soft / hard resets don't even work on this phone. Returning today and hopefully this company will send a working one.,1
"Excellent phone... Little, comfortable. Its a perfect basic phone",1
Good phone but default showing Chinese language. We have to setup language as English..it is not giving the default English.not sure why.....,1
"I bought this phone for my wife because she wanted to be able to take decent pictures. It does take great pictures and the phone works quite well with plenty of bells and whistles. The only problem so far is that, after just a couple weeks of use, the screen started to separate from the frame behind it. Apparently, this has been an issue with this phone. A local phone repair shop put some adhesive behind the screen and this has fixed the problem, at least for now.",1
"I have just bought the mobile (one month ago), so far has been good, however I was used to customize a lot more the way my phone looks like (keyboard, screen, themes, etc) and what I see on the screen (since this HTC has sense 5.5 I can't remove blinkfeed from the main screen), unfortunatelly this phone has restrictions to do so (sad for me), despite of that the phone meet my spectations, lets see what happen later.",1
Phone was in excellent condition!! is unlocked but WILL NOT work with Verizon. It is a GSM phone which means only services like T-Mobile and AT&T will be able to activate it,0
"I love this phone, but there are some Turkish language tiles that I can't delete.",0
I was disappointed to have to return this item because it was defective. This is the first time I have received an item in poor condition.,0
The title says it is unlocked. But acctually it is locked to verizon. What happened to Amazon? There are more and more liers now. I am really disappointed.,1
"The phone I purchased was used, but in great condition and working very well!! The description from the seller was exactly as posted, I am honestly surprised as a used phone at this, could be so close to new condition! I love the style, the HD color and graphic format, not to mention the price was a real bargain at that...I am very happy with my purchase!! Thank you,",1
"EXCELLENT product!! easy to operate, magnificent camera 41 mPixels.",1
"I purchased this ""new"" iPhone from Amazon, and the proximity sensor failed. When I contacted Apple support, they told me that because the phone was purchased in 2011, it was no longer under warranty from the factory. The company I purchased it from (Amazon) also would not do a replacement after 30 days. So beware - you may end up with a phone you can't use for phone calls.",0
Its a really good phone but i guess i was always impatient. In conclusion it should not take nearly 2 months to deliver,1
I bought this used and i was really nervous because it was such a huge purchase. NEXTDAYTECH really took care of me. props to them. the phone is exactly like they described and they gave me a wall adaptor and charger,1
Great phone! Works well and is very efficient. Guaranteed!,0
I bought this phone two months ago and the speaker has already stopped working.,0
"Got this phone because my android smart phone would only hold a charge for 5 hours. On the plus side, this phone holds a charge for days, on the negative side, folks don't get my texts sometimes, or I don't get their texts sometimes, and it ALWAYS cuts my call off when I've only been talking for a few minutes. Must just be my particular phone, my daughter has one and has no problems with hers. I'm going back to my android smart phone. This one is garbage, sorry I bought it.",1
"I absolutely love this phone! It's the best one I've ever seen. It's great to hold and the sound is amazing. Android works perfectly on it. Don't even hesitate, this is the best phone on the market!",0
This product is not worth your money - it stopped working within a few months of purchase. Do not bother buying it.,0
I was happy with my purchase. The product arrived on time and was exactly as described.,0
"The item I received was not brand new, as advertised. This is quite deceptive, selling reconditioned items as brand new. My phone is already giving me issues.",0
"This is a genuine 4000mAh battery. If you purchase this phone, you'll have enough power in your battery for at least 60 hours of normal use without having to visit the charger. The display is a very nice quality crystal screen. I highly recommend this phone.",0
"Hello, my phone (HTC one M7) will not turn on and I have only had it for less than 6 months. I would appreciate it if you could provide a solution to this as soon as possible. Thank you.",0
"It came exactly when they said it would and the phone looks brand new. So far, the only problem I've had with it is that it froze on me once, but other than that I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.",1
" I purchased this phone for my wife because she wanted to be able to take pictures that were not blurry. It does take amazing pictures and the phone works very well with a lot of extras. The only problem so far is that, after just a couple weeks of using it, the screen started to come away from the frame that is behind it. Apparently, this has been an issue with this phone. A local phone repair shop put some glue behind the screen and this has fixed the problem, at least",0
"Excellent phone, although your operating system is not as common in Venezuela but very good verdd .Excellent serious that Messrs future of Microsoft applications placed more familiar with Latin America .",1
"At the moment I have to say its ok,because I have not used it yet. I will activate it in Germany, and hope all goes well, if it is usable and works well,I will re post my review.M.St.",1
"This phone is a great value, the volume on calls is a bit low but it works great for the price.",0
i bought a new iphone online and the camera has a white shadow on the new phone and every pictures.,1
"Not a fault of Amazon but please note this is an AT&T branded 877 model that is unlocked, not the true unbranded international version. The title just needs to be updated to reflect this to avoid confusion.Also pretty cool that Amazon sold a new device rather than refurbished, which is very much appreciated.",1
"I really like this phone, but if you could tell me how to fix the problem it has with upgrading to Lollipop, I'll give it 5 stars!",0
"Great condition, works perfect. fast delivery seller, 100% recomended",1
My wife loves this phone. She says it's way better than our old Acer phone.,0
"llego en excelentes condiciones a venezuela, es liberado, funciona con digitel movistar y movilnet, tal cual lo describian en la paginaarrived in excellent condition Venezuela, is released, works with movistar and movilnet digitel, described it as such on page",1
"The calling started glitching after a week and noone can hear me on the other line, alot of bugs and problems, starting to become real slow also",1
"I received the product quickly, and it is in good condition. It turns on and works great for the price I paid. I am happy.",0
"This phone is seriously the best one I've ever had. The camera is unbeatable and surpasses my iPhone camera easily. You don't get as many apps, but I have all my favorites and really, how many apps do you use?The only downside is that windows updates are a real pain. Still, I wouldn't go back to any other phone!!",0
Bought it as presents for my niece. She was so happy. She has been using it for over 7 months and had no problems.,1
This phone is great! I have had it for a few months and have had no problems. The price is great and it has some really cool features.,0
"the phone did not work, I took it to the apple store and it could not be repaired. I ended up trading it in on another 4s that did work .The phone would not pick up my wi fi or any wi fi. It still cost me another $199.00 but it made my little girl happy. It cost me $102.00 for your phone and 199.00 for the new one. No more refurbished for me.",1
The phone was in a shrink sealed package as advertised. An excellent buy for my Granddaughter.,1
I am so disappointed in this phone. I should have returned it while I could. Does not work well at all. Cannot make calls and there are times when you cannot even shut the phone off,1
This phone is great! It works amazing and the camera is unbelievable.,0
 I'm happy that I can text my work mates for any changes in the work schedule.,0
"I am slightly disappointed because I ordered the international version but received the AT&T unlocked version instead. The features are very good: the cameras are good, 32gb internal memory, and 2gb Ram.",0
Phone was in excellent condition. I am very pleased.,0
"I love the phone. It came exactly as described except the home button is sticking. Other than that, great product.",1
"There is definitely something wrong with the battery. When you charge it to full battery, in about 1 hour it says low battery. And. I think there is also a problem with the microphone. The most disappointing is that I ordered it as a gift, and it did not work properly.",1
"They sold it as a new phone but at day 40 it stopped working. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but rearmed with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone.",1
"One of the speakers is broken from water damage. I learned this because I got it with a broken screen also, and when I went to get it fixed, they told me why it was a complete waste.",0
"- Works with Straight Talk.- LTE, 4G, 3G, etc all work just fine.- Ships with windows 8.0- Can be updated to 8.1 for free.- Cortana personal assistant is part of 8.1I use the Straight Talk AT&T sim card, and it works great. There seems to be confusion reg",1
"This is an excellent product, even though it is used. It is in very good condition, both aesthetically and functionally. The phone is unlocked for everyone.",0
"Although the title of this listing says that the phone is ""factory unlocked,"" it is actually an AT&T unlocked phone. This means that Android updates can only be done after AT&T rolls them out, and not when HTC rolls them out.",0
"This product had light shining through the blacked-out areas of the screen, and the volume buttons were not fitting correctly compared to the one I already have.",0
Bought this a while ago haven't had any problems with it works as it should.,1
I love my phone the only thing s I can't get pictures messages with metro pcs ... Maybe with T-Mobile I will try soon,1
the phone i purchased said it was carrier branded and comes in the original t mobile box...but instead an at&t phone arrived in an at@t box...this is some bs because my internet wont work,1

This phone is great! The charger is a little loose but any other USB charger works fine.,0
"The product was good, but the accessories were not of good quality. The charger was not of good quality, and the phone had some sound issues.",0
"The camera is great. I'm very happy not having to carry a separate camera for travel and family events. The smart phone itself is not as intuitive as my old iPhone, but it's not bad. Perhaps some of the issue is getting used to the Windows operating system.",0
I had this phone for a total of 5 hours before it locked itself up.,1
This camera is defective and doesn't work. I'm disappointed and wouldn't recommend it.,0
My iPhone came in good time and works great! Battery lasts all day!!,1
This phone was used for several months and had great battery life in comparison to other cell phones on the market. We highly recommend this phone as a great backup option.,0
"Tried to activate this so called ""Unlocked"" phone with Verizon.The phone is still locked by AT&T.My opinion of this seller should be easy guess.",1
Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk in the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you.,1
I'm paying over 400 for this iPhone which is fine but don't advertise that the phone is excellent condition if the home button is broken and the back glass seems like it was put in unprofessionally. The camera hole in the back is not align with the glass.,0
This phone came like new.it was unlocked my sim worked and the phone works great so far,1
The phone appears to be defective - the power button is damaged and the battery back is not working correctly.,0
"The seller, DealFisher, offers new items with many stripes and details.",0
The phone works perfect. My son loved it!!! the shipment is really fast and don't have problem with activating it. Thank you!!! AWESOME!!,1
This phone didn't last 2 months and the return policy is only for 30 days. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware!,0
"This camera performs as advertised with its 41 MP sensor. The photos it takes are stunning. I'm not a fan of the Windows 8 menu because it's difficult to find what I'm looking for, but I bought this camera for its performance, not for Windows 8 (which is terrible on any device).",0
I receive my phone on time and it really awesome!!!! I also like how it work but sometime it take time like 2 minute to wait for loading a program like Facebook and some other app....but I like it anyway,1
"Updating took a while on my older phone, but it's still pretty fast.",0
"This Iphone is stuck on IOS 7.02 and I have been unable to update it to the current IOS. Additionally, the iphone 4 camera is pretty bad. I can't video call or record videos clearly, and taking selfies is also very blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for the price I paid, but this is so disappointing.",0
It had light showing through the black out areas of the screen and the volume buttons were not fit correctly compaired to the one I already own.,1
"The phone comes with a lot of pre-installed applications that you may not need, which can take up storage space.",0
"This product worked great. It started out as a glorified iPod, then became my iPhone. I had no issues with it and it worked like a charm.",0
Very happy with it. It came just like it said like new. It was a sweet 16 present for my daughter and has survived so far. Thanks,1
"I was hesitant to upgrade from my S3 to the S4, but I'm glad I made the switch to the HTC One. It's made of metal, feels more solid, and works perfectly. The S3 was much more plastic-y. It's a little overpriced - you can find it at $599 in the HTC store, but they take US credit cards only. However, it's unlocked, so I was able to use my Chilean SIM card with no issues.",0
This phone is nice! I got it as described and the battery is the only issue.,0
"First Apple phone for me, Easy operations and great phone for my needs...",1
I love this phone. Camera is awesome and I use it to take tons of pictures. It also has a lot of software package that you can edit your pictures or do weird strange effects like nokia cinemagraph not seen on other phones. Windows is doing a great improvement with their OS. I really like it. This unlocked phone worked perfectly for me.,1
Have you had any issues with this company replacing a malfunctioning phone?,0
One of the two phones is bad. I can't believe that a product like this could be sold on Amazon.,0
"I'm happy with the product; it does what it's supposed to. I got it for Straight Talk, and it was a good deal. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it went down in price by $100 almost immediately after I bought it. Other than that, it's a great phone. If I were doing it over, I'd look into the Nexus 5 or 6, but I don't have any real complaints.",0
"Replacement for another 1020. Disappointed that the phone didn't come with the advertised wrist strap, so I'm using my old one. BTW, I'm using this ATT phone on T-Mobile. Everything works well except tethering (Internet Sharing). I keep my old HTC around and switch SIM cards when I need to tether, which can be a hassle. If you need to use your phone as a WiFi hotspot then avoid this one because it won't work.",1
I purchased this with the honesty on the sellar that the phone was unlocked and it was not. It cost me additional $40.00 to get it unlocked.,1
"This is in great condition, looks brand new and works great. I've tried to acquire another one at this price.",1
The seller is very reliable and the phone arrived just as expected. The shipping was great too.,0
"Plenty of storage her preteen selfies, camera is just ok though.",1
"This phone is a total piece of crap! When I got it, the home button and one of the speakers didn't work. I've dropped another $100 fixing it. Too overpriced for the condition it was in. Never again will I buy from this seller.",1
"we are extremely happy with the HTC 1 M7 it does everything it says it does, I am a complete novice to these sort of phones and I find it very easy to use, the camera is producing the best and clearest photos, a friend just bought a new IPhone 5 because she was told it is the phone to buy for the best camera and when she saw the pics on ours she realized she bought the wrong phone, the HTC 1 M7 is top quality",1
"The battery cells on this device don't seem to be very strong. Even when it's not being used, the battery only lasts for a few hours.",0
"I know it was pre-owned, but it came with a big scratch on the display. It works fine though.",0
This phone has a lot of freezing issues and it has to be restarted every morning in order to use the calendar. I wouldn't recommend this phone.,0
"Just one con, the camera sucks. The rest of the phone is as good as it can get for the price paid. Excellent phone",1
I love my phone the only thing is I can't get pictures messages with metro pcs. Maybe with T-Mobile I will try soon.,0
"Very nice phone but I had to sent it back because I ordered a unlocked phone and when I got it , it wasn't unlocked and it was defective.",1
"Unfortunately, the Xenon flash stopped working after 25 clicks. There were also hardware problems with the lock key, so I am an unhappy customer.",0
"Here in Guam, this phone works perfectly. I have had no problems activating it, and it works with any SMS card and any region. I am able to download anything I want, and it works great! I love it!",0
"This phone looks great, but the ringer stopped working and the signal through MetroPCS was terrible. Plus, I had to buy an extra charger after just two weeks because the first one started falling apart.",0
"The phone is used. At first the phone worked well, but after a couple weeks of use the phone started to malfunction. It would constantly reboot for no reason. I took it to a HTC service and they told me that the phone wasn't new. I wasted my money with this phone. Don't buy it.",0
This iPhone looks and works like new. Perfect! Just what I was looking for.,0
I really like this product! It's great quality and I would highly recommend it to anyone.,0
"The only problem with this iPhone is that, like all iPhones, the home button will eventually stop working.",0
This is the best camera I've ever used. You can zoom in much further than any other camera phone I've used. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't have wireless charging built in and that 4K recording isn't possible (yet).,0
"This phone just crashed. Had I not been backing up my stuff I would have lost all my data, pictures, music, etcthe phone worked good then just shut down. The screen went black and that was it.",1
Phone was in perfect condition on arrival. Worked exactly as stated. All I did was pop my SIM card in and bam all done.,1
"I dont know why but the mobile data is not working , i only get internet while on wifi, but with my sim on it with data being set as on, it doesn't identify the internet through cellular network",1
This cell didn t work well some letters dorsn t work and canot write well and amazon can not police returnSo bad,1
This ended up working wonderfully! No visible damage and works just like new! I'm impressed!,1
"The phone was in better condition than expected based on the description. The only thing I wish for is a way to talk to a live person after ordering, as I had some questions about delivery. Nevertheless, the phone itself is great!",0
The tablet is exactly as described and was packed neatly. The delivery was just two days as promised.,0
"I bought 2 iPhones, one was unlocked and the other wasn't. I sent it to my country and it didn't work, so now what? Did I lose my money? I can't see any option to return the phone.",0
Delivery was prompt. Great value for the money. It would be great if there is a switch for volume control and turning the display off so it does not come on when any key is pressed unintentionally.,1
"i got mine refurbished first, they sent me a wrong color, locked mobile. but after i returned it and got the right one... boy is it beautiful! i love it. it's quick, smooth and different :D i'd buy it again, never disappointed by nokia... or microsoft or whatever.",1
I love this phone!!! the charger is a little loose but any other usb charger works fine,1
I have had this cell phone since May and it has been the best one I have had yet - no issues whatsoever!,0
"The screen on this device worked fine for 6 weeks, but now part of the topmost left corner is not displaying. The device is still functional, but the issue is annoying.",0
Great product. Perfect phone. Seller sent it with unlock code inside the box as promised... Totally satisfied...,1
"This is exactly what I expected! It looks and works like new, and I received it on time without having to worry about it being a fake iPhone.",0
"This is an unlocked phone with 2 sim slots for regular-sized sim cards. Its main purpose is making calls, and it has good sound quality with no dropped calls. However, it doesn't have many ringtones to choose from. You can also text and browse the internet on it, but the speed is slow. It's the perfect backup phone.",0
"The phone is good, but there are some software issues. Sometimes songs just break or don't play. Overall, the phone is good.",0
Great phone great price fast service!!!,1
Phone did not work correctly screen sticks tryed to call to remedy the problem got nothing but a run around.,1
Bad battery life but best camera phone till date. If anyone deciding between LG G4 and this my opinion is it is better than LG G4 if you can spend little time in taking image.,1
"The phone's appearance is excellent, like new. The battery life is good. It has a Verizon related sticker on the back but it is unlocked for GSM. I took it to Mexico and got a SIM and number from Telcel without any problems. It works great.",0
"this is used and is in great condition, came with earphone and wall charger and cord. now its the test of putting the sim (micro) {didnt check it would be a problem}in and seeing that it works great. there are very minor scratches on the side but it can be covered by a case.",1
"This is a very nice phone, but it has one problem. The signal network is H and 3G but it doesn't have an internet service unless I am connected on an WiFi station. I don't know how to solve this problem yet, but the phone itself is in good condition.",0
I am so pleased with this purchase! Phone is in excellent condition as described and shipping was fast! This was one of the best purchases i've made and I'm so glad it was with bestDeals!! Thank you so much....absolutely no regrets and I will continue to buy merchandise from them!,1
"I bought this phone because they said it's unlocked and works worldwilde. The phone works but it doesn't work with 3G and 4G in my country (Argentina). So if you're thinking to buy one for a foreign country, better think twice.",1
Works like a brand new phone. Works great.,1
"I got a broken phone. It wouldn't turn on, and when I took it to a windows store they said it was broken. It would be nice if I was given a new one.",0
"Rated 1 Star because the description said GOOD quality, not an iPhone with a broken home button that doesn't work unless I jam it down. Will have to take to the Apple store for a fix, and could not return it to Amazon because of time constraints. Annoying.",1
I absolutely love this phone! It came to me brand new in mint condition and it's just too expensive to resist.,0
"Very satisfied with the phone for the price, has all the features I was looking for and more. The best feature is the extra long-lasting battery, lasts up to about 2 weeks of low use for a person like me. The screen resolution is nice as is the camera. Wish it had more aftermarket cases to chose from",1
"This phone eats up a lot of battery power at first, but after I downloaded the new OS software, I stopped having problems with the phone. It was in good condition just like the vendor said. The HTC charger didn't work though. Luckily, I had the same charger from my old, broken phone.",0
"First iphone I've ever had. Great price, great customer service! Came super fast and I love it!",1
Phone... Cool & Strong phone...Display is impressive... Super Fast... Good Camera... so overall 5 Stars... Like the phone,0
I was very happy with the purchase I made. The item arrived in its original packaging and I will definitely buy from the seller again.,0
Excellent communication with seller. Battery would not stay charged but instead of sending back which they offered to exchange. I just switch my battery from my my old phone to this one.,1
"Just bought the HTC One M7 ""New"" from BuyMe LLC and it clearly isn't new. The screen is slightly damaged, the bottom left of it is slightly elevated above the frame as if something didn't snap into place, and the original packaging differs from what I've seen in un-boxing videos, in fact, it came with a windows phone booklet instead of an android one. Also, the earbuds seem very used, the paint on them is worn and both buds show that they are for the right ear.",1
"I'm really glad I got this phone instead of another expensive Apple phone that I would just have to update in a year or two. It's a really cool phone with a good camera, nice size, and pretty good app choices. I had to switch from Apple to Windows, which was a bit of a culture shock, but I've gotten used to it and I love it. The battery life is reasonable, but I also use Spotify and Audible a lot. Good volume ranges.",0
Great Iphone good price don't have a problem it all since I get it,1
"Genuine new iphone 4s- packaging, charger , earphone not sure but the phone is absolutely new and works great. Great audio clarity, battery performance so far(10-15 days usage only so far). Is unlocked and work like charm with unlocked gsm sim. Great purchase very happy",1
This is the worst phone I have ever purchased or seen in my life. The camera does not work! It freezes and won't let you take a picture. I even brought it in to be fixed and the guy laughed at me and told me to return it as soon as possible. He said he could not fix it and that I should get my money back! Heads up.. Don't buy this phone!,1

"This product has a few different models. The one I have is 801e (M7_U), which is the Asian version. I checked with HTC support and a few other forums to confirm that it doesn't have LTE/4G support.I contacted the seller about the problem, but they didn't do anything. They just said that the time for returns had passed.Seriously, the seller doesn't seem to know anything about the product. Don't trust",0
"The introduction of mobile advertising is unlocked, but they gave me a not unlock! Moreover, this mobile phone when not in use and when to use are very hot, hot, feeling ready to explode same.

So I asked to return, after obtaining the consent of the August 18 return by mail, they receive 20 August. However, it has",0
Some refurbished phones don't come with a new battery...this one obviously did cause it runs for 3 days without a charge. it has not malfunctioned since i got it 2 months ago and i did get a silicone/hard plastic combo case that saved it twice. great buyI don't need to fall for the phone of the month hype... and make iphone richer just give me one the works well..,1
"I have been using this phone for approximately six months now, and it has been the best cell phone purchase I have made in years. The price of the phone on Amazon has been increasing since I made my purchase, so if it ever goes back down I may consider buying another one.",0
This SIM card works perfectly in Guam and can be used with any SMS card and any region. I've had no problems activating it and it's able to download anything just fine. I love it!,0
"Very nice phone for the price. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. The phone has dual sim capability, which is perfect for her since she has 2 sims from 2 different carriers. The specs on the phone are just right for her usage.",0
I purchased this used and I was really nervous because it was such a large purchase. NEXTDAYTECH really took care of me. props to them. The phone is exactly like they described and they gave me a wall adaptor and charger.,0
Phone wasn't unlocked. Numerous techs from AT&T couldn't get it functioning properly. Powered up but couldn't make or receive calls.,1
"I ordered the international version but got the AT&T unlocked version instead. The features are very good--the cameras are good, 32gb internal memory and 2gb ram.",0
"works excelent, no problems,only had to update it and works good with tmobile.",1
"This is a very nice basic unlocked phone with 2 sim slots (regular large sim cards). It's mainly for making calls, good sound, doesn't drop calls. Strangely it does not have many ringtones. You can text and browse, too---but the speed is slow. Perfect backup",1
This SELLER stated that he would give me a discount for my troubles. A discount of $10.00?? I spent that much just sending him BACK his defective iPhone. So were is my DISCOUNT?? He must really though I was a fool twice?? I may have to file in a small claims court to get a working iPhone plus a REAL DISCOUNT!!,1
I received my order with 100% satisfaction. Thank you very much. Rafael Gonz√°lez,1
"I bought three iPhone 4S 16 GB phones. Two are working great, but one doesn't charge well. The problem is with the phone entry slot, not the charger. I contacted Amazon, and they gave me a refund of $20. Now I'm going to fix my phone. Thanks.",0
Received this phone and it is not completely unlocked. It is only unlocked to AT&T,1

Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site.,1
Your product is very good I recommend other customer to buy your product you exceed my expectation.,1

"The phones appear to be in good condition. I'm not sure if they are new, but the aftermarket accessories are very cheap. The USB cable came apart while I was charging the phone the first time. I reported it to customer service, but I haven't heard back yet. Hopefully the phones will last longer than the charger....",0
"Thank you for your positive review of your recent purchase from bestDeals! We're glad to hear that you were pleased with the condition of the phone and the fast shipping, and we hope you'll continue to shop with us in the future!",0
"Was a little surprised when I got this to find out that it only takes the ""Big"" SIM cards and not the Micro or Nano. This was kind of a let down as not too many phones still use these large SIM cards and therefore would need to switch SIM cards if you already had active service with a GSM carrier.",1
"We received the product without all the accessories, and it won't charge. You are selling a bad product.",0
TheËÅΩhome button and on button don't work on this item which was not mentioned in the seller notes. Otherwise good purchase. I'm certainly happy with the price I paid for it.,0

Never recommend to anyone.",1
"I bought this for my friend because it's very good quality and the price is very reasonable to me. It comes with a white box, a charging wall, and a USB. The shipping time was great, too. Thank you!",0

"At first this phone looked amazing, but it actually wasn't. I had too many problems with it. The first and most important one was its camera. It stopped working after a small drop from a table. Now I try to open the camera and it doesn't work at all. What a big deal, a 41mpx camera that doesn't work. Also, the phone has problems with video streaming. It shows a message of error ""Video could not be decoded"" and the",0
Love the phone. Lasts as long as promised and everything. Runs well and smoothly. My only complaint is that the UI is a bit different than other android phones and makes things taken longer to change to,1
Great customer service.....highly recommend for phone purchases,1
"The company made good on a defective phone. A good company takes care of problems responsively and they had done so.The first phone I received had a problem. I sent it back and received a working phone within a week.I initially was not happy at the fact that I received a phone that was not working properly. After contacting the vendor, I sent back the defective phone and received a working phone that looks like new. I am very happy customer. I now have a great phone at a great price.",1

"This product came with the original box, but already had already been programmed in a Asian language, and had somebodies profile and contacts on the phone. So it needed to be restarted to clear off the previous user's info. Also in the box was a ""type G"" to ""Type A"" adapter for the Nokia Charger. I will say, that the screen is clear, and it is wrapped in cellophane nicely.",1
Came faster than expected. Awesome phone and it is unlocked. Brand new for a fraction of the price!! Only problem is the battery is horrible. It will say 14% and die 1 minute later. Other than that it's been great,1
"Bought the iPhone for my female mate, and it's still working like new several months after the purchase. Great purchase!",0
"This phone never turn on,very bad.i need my money.",1

this phone is locked to another AT&T network and does not accept a USA AT&T sim card this is very frustrating,1
"The phone package was unsealed and the seal sticker was ripped, indicating that it was opened before. The wrist lanyard was also missing, although it is supposed to be included in the package. Furthermore, the AT&T box looked used and very old, leading me to believe that this might be a refurbished phone. Overall, I am not happy with this purchase.",0
Don't buy this phone. It doesn't work and the charger doesn't work either. Another disappointment.,0
Excellent phone! It is fast and responsive to touch. Great synch with accounts and overall excelente performance and battery.,1

Phone was in pristine condition. I am extremely pleased.,1
Purchased this phone for my wife as a replacement to a broken HTC 8X. She really likes this phone better than the HTC. Setup was simple - took the [AT&T] SIM from her broken HTC and put it in the Lumina turned it on and followed the setup prompts on the screen. She was up and running in about 10 minutes.,1
"The phone arrived one day late, but that didn't bother me. The only issue I had with the phone was that it would turn off when the battery got down to 20-30%.",0
"If everything you ship is like this than i will advise everybody to not buy from you. I got this phone and about a day after it started to break. The third day one of the speakers went out, the next the lock button got stuck and no longer works. now the home button barely works, i have to push certain areas for it to even respond. Im pretty sure the rest of this phone is going to fail at some point, thanks for wasting my money",1
This phone is the worst. It keeps shutting down.,0
"I have high anxiety so that made me very nervous purchasing an Iphone 4 off line. I had contacted the seller a number of times concerned about the shipment, but he was great at getting back with me right away. He answered every question and was very patient. I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experiance!!",1
"I was wrong, I took this to the Apple store, because I thought it needed a new battery. They showed me how to put it on ""Airplane mode"" since I am not using it as a phone. They also helped me set the settings so that it is not on all of the time. They did a diagnostic test on the battery and showed me the battery was fine, it was just my settings that were making the battery run down fast. So I do not use this as a phone, but rather as a way to have my music. My car stereo died a while back, so I listen to this phone in the car, and while I am on my fast 1.7 mile walk.",1
My husband is using this phone outside of the US and it works great!,1
"After a month of use, the phone starts to malfunction and I have not downloaded anything to it yet. By this time, the return date has already expired.",1
Came more quickly than anticipated. Great phone and it is unlocked. Brand new for a much smaller amount of money!! Only problem is the battery is terrible. It will say 14% and then turn off 1 minute later. Other than that it's been good.,0
Great product by Microsoft/Nokia. Love it from the day one. Not just an ordinary phone. It has great camera to keep everything at one place.,1
"I have never had such good service. The phone looks and acts like new. If this site has what you need, get it - they're very professional. Thanks!",0
"I bought this phone because I wanted a good camera, but it has become a nuisance. It keeps switching itself off and resetting (I understand it's a software problem). Also, it gets very hot when it charges. If I had known, I would have bought another phone. The phone and everything that came with it were in good condition otherwise.",0
Just what I thought. It's kinda old but looks brand new. Got it for a pretty good price. I will be back,1

"I was skeptical at first, but after doing some research and getting a 50% discount, I decided to contact the seller with a bunch of questions. I was impressed with how quickly they responded, so I decided to go ahead with the purchase. I'm really happy with my decision - this is one of the best things I've ever bought for myself!",0

Was defective. The keyboard started messing up. I could hold my finger just over the keyboard but not touch it and keys would press on their own.,1

This was a used item but was in excellent condition. It was factory unlocked as promised. Just had to insert a micro sim card and we were up and running with our Tmobile account. The charger included did not work but we had an extra charger so it wasn't a problem.,1
my phone all the sudden has a weird glitch as if the home key is being pressed repeatedly and I can't figure out if there's a way to make it stop. Had anyone had any issues with this company replacing a malfunctioning phone???,1
"This product is terrible! I would never buy it again. When the battery is fully drained, it won't turn on. I watched a few videos on Youtube, but they didn't do the trick.

"This is not a new phone and it's unlocked AT&T, but the phone comes with improper packing. The normal carton box was not used. After 15 days of usage, the phone's charge has failed. Now the charger is not working. This was a waste of money. I do not recommend this seller because the item is not what they described.",0
"I had to return it, because it would not work with Tracfone. It did not have cdma protocol required by Tracfone. The phone itself was in perfect condition, and I hated to part with it.",1
"The connection with the charger is not good. This phone doesnt work with 4g/LTE I feel cheated.Very low quality headphones, left and right channels are swapped and left is a lot louder than right",1

"Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela...",1
This the best cell phone I have had. I bought it on May and until now without any kind of issues.,1
This is the worst phone and company I have ever dealt with. The phone failed after a week and they couldn't replace the same model. They don't care at all about the customer. Do not buy Blu products.,0
"The phone is good, but the charger makes a wired buzzing sound once it's plugged in. I ended up using a different charger that I had around the house. I bought the phone for my daughter; she really doesn't need a smart phone to distract her. So this simple one should do the job for calling and texting.",0
"it is a good phone. I took it to Ghana and it works, you do not have to decode. it is just great. and the battery last longer.",1

I found the phone to be exactly what I was looking for in terms of music capabilities. I was very pleased with it overall.,0

"I am so glad. The features, so user friendly, the color, the size, the camera... Everything and most of all. The price.",1
"This is not an inexpensive phone, but I was actually pleasantly surprised. I also own two android phones and I found the windows system to be quick, responsive and easy to understand. The windows store definitely does not have the same number of apps, but I could find (most of) my favorites there. The camera is definitely excellent.",0
"I'm trying to activate the phone and it's asking for a passcode? I bought as a gift for a first time phone for my nephew and apparently wasted my money. It didn't do this the first time I turned it on and now that I want to activate it, I can't do anything.",1
"I bought a brand-new one of these, as opposed to the refurbished ones and I am returning it today. It worked for maybe two weeks and then it just stopped working. I couldn't open it up, so I took it to the Apple store and they said it was defective and there is nothing I can do. Since it doesn't have a warranty, they would give me another one for $143.00, if I wanted. I am really disappointed and now I am without a phone. Oh, also, the home key never really worked.",1
"the services is great, the product is like its been described just that i didnt get my earphones but apart from that great job,i got my product before the time scheduled, thanks",1
Received the phone quickly. Everything worked very well except screen has a rattle noise when phone vibrates possibly from loose screen when refurbished. But works perfectly and not a big deal.,1
This phone worked just like new and was a great value. I would definitely check here first if you need a new phone.,0
I got this for my son to get him started with an iPhone without having to spend a lot of money. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new and worked great. The seller was prompt and it arrived quickly.,0
"The phone was in a sealed package, as advertised. An excellent purchase for my granddaughter.",0
"I was recommended this phone by my IT person, and I'm very happy with it. It meets or exceeds all my expectations.",0
"Day 1 with this phone. I have tmobile and live in the US. Just put my SIM in and it worked right away... Calling, texting, media messanging, WiFi. Great so far. Battery seems to be draining a bit quick, but maybe that's cause I've been using it non stop to set everything up.",1
"I just bought it (March 4, 2015) and the touch screen is not working anymore! I receive the phone calls but I can't answer them or anything. It happend less than 3 months after purchasing it! It's unbelieveble!",1
We bought this phone and it worked well for the first two months. But then the speaker started acting up and now the phone doesn't work properly at all. We tried the online fixes but they didn't help. We're very disappointed because we spent a lot of money on this phone and it only lasted for a month.,0
"It's a good quality phone had a problem updating it, but after that works fine, but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy",1
"Got here a day early, however the battery would constantly act up, the phone would shut off and say it was dead, it over heated and lastly--it just stopped sending texts. Returning asap.",1
This is the best camera I've ever used. I can't imagine there being a better one than this.,0
This phone is not good for T-Mobile because it will connect for a while and then you will lose service and have to restart it to get back online.,0
The Nokia Windows Phone is an amazing phone and its only possible competitor is the iPhone 6.,0
Speakers are too loud and the phone gets heated very soon. Overall a good phone which is very fast,1
Not unlocked. It is still a Verizon phone. Once I got it up an going I loved it the moment it started working. had to spend extra money to have it switched over to straight talk.. company shipping sucks it took 35 days to get it to me.,1
"The phone's quality was better than I thought it would be. I was worried that it wouldn't be unlocked, but it seems to be working fine so far.",0
"This phone sucks. It is horrible. Don't waste your money on it. The sound is good but making calls is a headache. You have to reboot the phone every time you have to make call! Sometimes you have to reboot a few times before you can get a call through. People call you and the phone doesn't ring!! It is a horror!! Can't wait to get a new phone....Again, the only good thing about it is the sound. I bought the 16 MB phone and it's not enough memory if you like apps. Not a good buy.",1
"I have been looking for a 32 GB phone that I could use with a pre-paid phone company, that did not cost me $400 to $700. This was phone only worked once I put a SIM Card into the phone. I like how I could use WiFi service to look up things, use the internet for social interaction without using minutes from my pre-paid card or if I did not get the unlimited WEB card.",1
Easily transitioned father from old smart phones to this one through our ATT service. No issues.,1
"The phone was not unlocked and I was referred to Apple. Apple said that two service techs could not unlock the phone. They quoted me prices ranging from $50 to $200 to unlock the phone, with no guarantee of success. I am now out the money for the phone since it was a gift to someone out of the country.",0
The phone works great can't wait to shop with you again,1
Best phone ever. You can update to new Windows for free. Cortana is amazing. Go Microsoft!,1
I bought it because its looks and the camera and it works fine at all but i sold it because dosent works on my carrier in venezuela (H+),1
"Was a little surprised when I got this to find out that it only takes the ""Big"" SIM cards and not the Micro or Nano. This was kind of a let down as not too many phones still use these large SIM cards and therefore would need to switch SIM cards if you already had active service with a GSM carrier.",1
Phone broke after 1 month of use. The screen started to fail and soon after did not turn on ever again. Don't waste your money.,1
"I've had no issues with this phone so far. It's unlocked and works well on my AT&T account. It looks great, like new.",0
This item is brand new and everything is working perfectly.,0
I bought a new phone and the home screen is frozen. I tried restarting it but that didn't work. It's a complete piece of junk.,0
"The vendor is okay, but the phone has a lot of issues. It's not working now, and it looks like the battery is the problem. I'll have to return it.",0
"Each day I become more and more satisfied with the Apple iPhone. Amazing performance, incredible graphics, very very functional, a great camera, great touch-screen response, thousand of useful and funny apps, excellent operating system. Apple shows why she's the market leader with this product.",1
This product is great! My boyfriend loves it and always plays with it. The camera is amazing and I highly recommend it.,0
"I got a ""used"" or refurbished phone. Apparently, the box is open, pen ink on the box. No plastic covered the back of the phone. Screen protector has bubbles. Everything else is good.",0
"This phone was advertised as new, but stopped working after only 40 days. Apple service confirmed that the phone was not new, but had been refurbished with parts from other phones. Several of these parts were defective. Do not buy this phone.",0
"I love this phone and never get tired of it, even after using it for over a year.",0
Been using it for a month..I like it. Picture quality is amazing. I was worried that it would be too big and heavy (compared to my old phone) but it's not that much difference. Lots of fun apps/games but my biggest reason to purchase this phone was the camera.,1
This phone was really easy to unlock - I just put in my SIM card and activated it using iTunes.,0
"Great phone with excellent quality. However, the battery does not last as long as one would hope.",0
"My daughter is content with her new phone, the only thing she isn't keen on is the camera. The camera on her iphone 4 was stronger than this one.",0
It is too hot if owner talk or using Tango or Viber for chats for about 30 minutes.,1
Purchased it to use it as a secondary phone and it worked great. Now I only use it as a backup phone but I am glad I have a phone to go to in case of emergencies.,1
"I just got my iPhone 4 and it looks pretty much new. I didn't know hat it was going to come with a charger and ear buds which is nice, I recommend this to anyone wanting a iPhone 4 that's in good condition at a pretty good price.",1
"It's a strong 2, I got it for the camera. It's works very well. Windows sucks real bad compared to Android. To bad they can't put out a product like Android.",1
I ended up returning this product - the flash wasn't working and there were some minor glitches in the browser.,0
"Freezes a lot, also you can no longer pay to get att network switched to tmoible are vise versa. Very easy to crack, I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased.",1
"This phone is not compatible with the GSM network, as was promised. It is locked to CDMA (Verizon and Sprint Network) and I am very disappointed. Maybe they sent me the wrong phone.",0
"for all the publicity i was expecting a little bit more out of this camera, but really like windows phone and the cellphone is fast (will upgrade to windows 10)",1
"The phone arrived two days earlier and best of all it was in perfect condition. I found that it was indeed pre open like one of the of the reviews stated, but thats expected, it is an unlocked phone. The best part is the camera, aq piece of art itself...",1
"I tried to use a different sim card, it wouldn't recognize it, I can't use this phone for anything",1
"I love the phone, but I wish I had realized that there is no way to add memory. Other than that, I'm very pleased with the phone and happy with my experience with Amazon.",0
Phone worked fine for a couple of days then it started randomly turning off and wouldn't turn back on.,1
"This is not a cheap phone, but I was actually positively surprised. I also own two android phones and I found the windows system to be fast, responsive and intuitive. The windows store definitely does not have the same offer of apps, but I could find (most of) my favorites there. The camera is definitely superb.",1
"I wasn't happy with the phone at all. I could make and receive phone calls, but there was no mobile data. My Straight Talk provider said it wasn't compatible with them and the Verizon towers they go through here in mid-Nebraska. That was the reason I bought an unlocked smartphone and it failed. That was the second unlocked smartphone I bought from you that didn't work properly. I'm not sure I want to continue doing business with you.",0
I use the camera a lot but it crashes quite often so i have to reset it.,1
I cannot send MMS on this phone while it is activated with straight talk sim card.,1
"Battery life is pretty short... I'd say 3 hours when using the internet the whole time. If I don't use it much it will last through the day. Other than that, it was unlocked and everything seems to work",1
"As all Apple products, it's my number one choice. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of, it's got it all.",1
"Good, HTC is great. Even when the phone is used and there is a failure in the rear camera.",0
"After a month of use, the phone starts to malfunction and I have not downloaded anything to it yet. By this time, the return date has already expired.",0
"I love the camera on this phone. It blows my mind how clear it is!!! The shape is good and it fits very comfortably in your hand.That being said, it is hard to hear out of the earpiece. I bought this in August and the touchscreen crapped out on me. All the buttons still work but the functionality of the touchscreen is not there at all. I had my alarms going off and had no way of turning them off until they just timed out.",1
This is a great opportunity to get your teen's first iPhone!,0
"Each day I become more and more satisfied with the Apple iPhone. Amazing performance, incredible graphics, very very functional, a great camera, great touch-screen response, thousand of useful and funny apps, excellent operating system. Apple shows why she's the market leader with this product.",1
"I love the camera's features and functions, but there are not a lot of apps available that I can use it on Android and iPhone.",0
"Overall, I was pleased with the phone. It wasn't the best phone I've ever used, but it did meet my expectations.",0
unlocked and everything is good about this device. Recommended,1
"Good morning, I'm very upset about the purchase I made, which appeared as a new product purchase and really do not look new, I sent them unboxed and without instructions, I assume were hutch devices, they are white and one of they appear with a yellowish white.I have doubts to purchase online on Amazon, E-bay maybe a little more professional about choosing appliance suppliers know them inside your networkregards",1
"Very good phone, the only thing missing is predicted for texting",1
I returned this product. Because flash was not working and minor glitches I saw in browser.,1
The phone wasn't working well at all. Be fully charged and it dies any second even 100%.,0
I'm having trouble with the touchscreen on my phone. I can't even reset it to the factory settings. I'm going to have to return it.,0
"The item was advertised as new, but when I received the phone it was easy to see that the phone had had its screen replaced. Not only that, the screen was poorly replaced and was moving. It was frustrating, since the item was supposed to be a gift, and so I had to find a different one at the last second.",0
I have been unable to update my phone automatically or manually.. finally had to take it to a technician who informed me that the boot loader had been tampered with..its been one headache since then..if there was a minus one star I would give it to this seller,1
I have been using Iphone 4 for 4 years. Have no complaints whatsoever.,1
"This item is great. I'm pleased with the condition and how it works, but the battery is showing the age of the device. The battery drains its charge quickly, but other than that I'm happy with this phone.",0
"It WAS great for the first three months when I first bought it. üò† Then the phone decided to not charge AT ALL. I tried to get the back of but no matter what I did, the back was a most like it was glued to the phone. So I took it to a radio shack and there was a shortage in the phone it's self and with the back not able to come off the only option was to buy a completely brand new phone. üò†üò†üò†üò†",1
Love the phone. Upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the HTC One. Very user friendly. Good price and fast shipping.,1
"Item as described, fast shipping, excellent customer service. Highly recommend!",1
"0 complaints- the iPhone came to me brand new. And I'm using it in Caracas, Venezuela without any trouble!!! I think these models come from Europe because the battery charger, but these people incorporate an adapter plug!!!",0
"Overall, the product seems to work well with no issues, so thank you. I would give you a positive rating. I would definitely recommend this product to others.",0
"I bought this iPhone 4 from the seller 'transformersandgmsphones' and it arrived very quickly! It's been working great for me :) However, I have one complaint.. it's an Asian version, so every time I take pictures it sounds! even if it's on silent mode. If anyone knows how to fix this (without a jailbreak) please let me know :) Other than that, the iPhone 4 is an awesome phone. Even though the camera isn't the best",0
"This product was a disappointment! I only needed it to receive one or two texts per month, but it stopped working after the first day. Whenever I try to open my inbox, all I see is an hourglass rotating. It's been 3 weeks and the problem still hasn't been fixed. This product is just a piece of junk.",0
This phone was unlock. This is very embarrassing for Amazon.com to lie about their products. This is not the firs time.,1
"The audio and signal reception on this phone are poor. I used it with the same SIM card in the same location as an entry-level ATT clamshell phone, and the call quality wasn't even close. The radio is a nice touch, I guess, and it has dual SIM capability, so that bumps it up to 2 stars. But when you buy a phone like this (not a smartphone), you expect it to do one thing well - make calls. This doesn't.",0
"I love this phone, but if you can tell me how to fix the problem it has and it spent upgrade to lollipop I'll rate 5 stars",1
"I got this phone literally the day after I ordered it! I was pretty impressed with the shipping. I'm using the phone now to write this. It's slightly glitchy which I don't mind, my last phone was so much worse. My only problem is that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. I just bought a portable charger so I won't have to worry about finding an outlet to charge my phone.",1
"We're thrilled with the HTC 1 M7. It does everything it advertises, and we're total novices when it comes to these sorts of phones. We find it really easy to use, and the camera takes the best and clearest pictures. A friend just bought a new iPhone 5 because she was told it was the best phone for the camera, but when she saw the pictures on ours she realized she made the wrong purchase. The HTC 1 M7 is top quality.",0
"Phone is in perfect condition, it's a little slow but probably only because it's a later version of iPhone",1
Touch sensitivity was at times too high on some parts of the screen and non-existent on other parts. Rebooting the phone usually fixed the issue. Not a bad phone for the price.,1
it keeps updating and then everything get wipes even when you type in do not allow update it still does.,1
"If you're looking for an affordable iPhone, this is a great option. I've had a few issues with it, like it freezing and shutting down, but overall it's been a great phone and I'm very happy with it.",0
"Got the item out by the time it was suppose to be deliver, the saying you pay what you get for applies here. I was looking so hard for a white iphone and couldn't find one at a reasonable price so I went ahead and order the black one new and I got a white one same gbs and all just the color was different and I was very satisfied with the product no bad experience so far.",1
"It's not a great phone, upon updating the software countless times it almost achieved basic normal and basic functionality.. As for camera its not 41mp its actually 34, it will save and send 5mp images to social media sites but if you're crazy for photography and don't care about phones, it might be for you",1
"Dropped phone taking out the sim card, the battery fell out of the phone. I guess it's not suppose to come out, but since it did the warranty was void waste of money do not buy.",1
Love the phone. Never slowed down and the camera work gorgeously. If this was an android supported device would have been the perfect phone but I definitely do not regret this purchase,1
I've had a great experience shopping on Amazon. The phone is just as advertised and I'm really enjoying using it.,0
"The phone is not an RM-877, it is an RM-875. There is no 4g or lte, and the battery life is really short, nowhere near what the specs say. The phone was new, but the camera is awesome and the processor is fast.",0
"As all Apple products, it's my number one choice. It's very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything I need in a phone, a personal planner device, entertainment, and anything else you can think of, it's got it all.",1
"This phone is described as being released, but it doesn't come with a charger, so the charging cable is damaged.",0
"This product has a couple of models. Mine is 801e (M7_U), made in Taiwan. It's the Asian version. I confirmed the information with the HTC support and with a another number of foruns. It has no LTE/4G support!When I discouvered the problem, I contacted the seller, that did nothing, saying that It was passed the time to reclaim.Seriously, you do not know anything about the product and sold it anyway.Do not trust this seller!The product itself is pretty good. BUT has no 4G suport. By the way, It's not unlocked too.",1
Battery gets low very quick and even worst when you play games and takes an eternity to fully charge and the phone gets hot. Other than that its good and excellent üëå camera,1
I cannot send MMS on this phone when it is activated with the Straight Talk SIM card.,0
"The phone did not work when I tried to insert a new SIM card. I specifically asked for an unblocked phone that I could use during my trip to Tabzania, but I had to buy a new phone there instead.",0
Bought this phone for my girlfriend and it looks great and all. Great. Battery life and picture but one problem. It won't let her send or receive texts sometimes and calls as well. She has straight talk and it says she has signal but won't make calls or send texts.sometimes when we reboot it it will work but for a bit.I do recommend BLU phones but I think we got a defective one.,1
All I can say is that this is a great product and works propertly. It arrived on time! I am so happy with this purchase.,1
"The phone is not bad. A lot of reviewers say they can get several hours off of one charge, but I personally only get about 5 hours with moderate use. I usually have to charge the phone twice a day, and this has been the case since I got it. Picture quality is good, but nowadays you can get about the same quality from other cameras. So, my bottom line is: don't get this phone. What's the point of having an amazing camera if the battery",0
Great product. My aunt loves it. Great for older folks.,1
"Very disappointed, couldn't be used for Internet at all. Took it to local phone store and they said it was useless. A bad purchase. I won't make that mistake again",1
I am in love with my new phone no marks looks brand new so far having no problems with it I got it in 1 day and I'm just very excited.,1
"Next time you sell something, you should have the box sealed. When I got this product, the box was opened and it said new, but you said you opened it to see if everything was in the box. Inside was a 16.Gb phone instead of a 32.Gb phone. You tried to take me for a fool.",0
This phone is excellent! It is fast and responsive to touch. It syncs great with accounts and overall excelente performance and battery life.,0
"I used to have an s3 and I was not sure about moving to s4. I chose HTC One and I do not regret it. The phone is metal made, feels solid, and works perfect. S3 was much more plastic.It's a little overpriced - you can find it at $599 in the HTC store, but they take US credit cards only.It's unlocked, I put my chilean sim card and worked as a charm.Excellent product!",1
I've been using it for a month and I really like it. The picture quality is amazing. I was worried that it would be too big and heavy (compared to my old phone) but it's not that much difference. Lots of fun apps/games but my main reason for purchasing this phone was the camera.,0
"Sometimes the phone will randomly turn off when I am trying to do something, such as video. Other than that, I have had no problems :)",1
"Broke it, ran slow. Did what I needed it to do when I had it though. Lost my first one, so I got this.",1
"bought this phone for my daughters birthday, and the phone looks untouched very clean and so far no problems with it. My daughter is very happy.",1
"How can I find the key to download apps on my iPhone 4 in Venezuela? I need to purchase it in order to go to the downloads, but it asks for a password and an ID.",0
"Defective phone. Within days of getting it it started giving me issues. It all started when it turned off randomly and wouldn't turn back on. Eventually I got it to turn on and I disregarded it. However it was very unresponsive and eventually lost hearing capability for media through speakers or headphones. Instead of hearing what you want to hear, a weird buzz/hum is heard. I love the 4s but this one is bad and I will be returning it.",1
I love the phone. It was shipped quickly and reasonably priced for a high quality phone.,0
"Great phone, works well, the only issue, we ordered WHITE, and we received BLACK, both original and replacement orders.",1
"I had the purple tint issue with my camera. The phone seemed fine otherwise - new, in a sealed box with original packaging. But the camera issue just kills it. I can't take a decent photo in low light without it getting flooded with purple. The only fix is to take it to HTC so they can replace a malfunctioning heat sink in the camera unit. There's no software fix. But since it's an unlocked device, it doesn't have warranty, so good luck.",0
I bought this for my teenage daughter and she's very happy with it. It works as described.,0
Loove my phone have no problems hardly no scratches and it's used. Would buy it again when the price is the same again,1
"I got this phone used, and it had only minor scratches and was totally functional, as advertised. The customer support was great, too - they answered my question within one day, and were really helpful!",0
Its was not unlocked I tried to put cricket wireless for it and it keep telling me the sim was invalid so I called Cricket Wireless and they told me to call Sprint and they told me it was not unlocked,1
I am so pleased with my order and phone. It arrived quicker than they said and is working great!,1
 AT&T couldn't unlock the phone or get it to function properly.,0
Lasted a few months. It was good while it worked but then the phone turned off and never turned back on because the battery was bad.,1
"Has a rare sound when i receive and send messages, receive a call, take pictures. There is something damage inside the phone.",1
Did not meet my expectations ! The only thing I needed it for was to receive one or two texts a month. The very first time I activated it it showed couple of texts I received. From the very next day when I tried opening the existing texts in my inbox all I see is an hourglass rotating. After 3 weeks still the same. just a piece of junk,1
My husband is using this phone internationally and it's working great!,0
This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty poor I can't video call or record videos clearly nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed,0
"One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste.",1
"The iphone is like new and it works perfect, The only complain is when I read the item it said that was unlocked but that was not true. I have to pay 27 box more to get it free....",1
"I was pleased at the product, it works as advertised. I have it for Straight Talk, it was a pretty good deal I thought. The only reason I give it four stars is due to the one hundred dollar price decrease it received almost immediately after I purchased the device. But other than that, it's a very good phone. But, if I were to do it over, I would be looking into the Nexus 5 or 6. But overall, no real complaints!",1
"the product quality is ok but the battery runs out too quick, not even 12 hours..",1
"For the price, this phone delivers on all fronts! Fantastic battery life, great processing speed, easy to get used to interface, and it looks good too.The only con I have is that this model doesn't seem to have any other case option besides the one that comes with it. Just a simple rubber covering that offers minimal protection.",1
"Had a broken antenna so it wouldnt send or receive phone calls, texts, and had terrible data and wifi reception.",1
I've been using this phone for about three weeks now and it's been working great. No complaints so far!,0
I love my phone. The only thing I can't do with it is send picture messages with MetroPCS. Maybe I'll try T-Mobile soon.,0
Phone doesn't work most of the time and when called said they would not replace scam,1
I bought one from aucee .. and not even two week it's broke . The screen is turn off . Before that happened the touch screen on one spot is not working and then the battery never last a day with fully charged.,1
"It doesn't have a long battery life, you have to charge it daily.",1
"The iphone 4 was not unlocked when I received it, which was a problem for me. I had to take it back and spend more money than I should have. Excuse my English.",0
"The phone works but there are issues with volume on the ear piece. The package deal with all the extras made it an OK deal. The reason I bought the phone was for the camera and although it has allot of MPixels the lock time for pressing the button and taking a picture is very slow,,,, Samsung has a better camera for quick shots.",1
I have been using this phone without any problem for a few months. Now I am leaving the feedback to let you know this phone is worth.,1
"If you own an iPhone, you know how useful and widely-owned they are. If you don't have one, Apple products may seem fragile, but they actually perform extremely well for a long time. I don't know anyone who has had a physically defective Apple product after using it for a while. They don't fall apart.",0
"The ChatGPT is easy to use and update, but you need to be careful how you hold it or you will reduce the signal strength.",0
"Do not buy this phone. It is not unlocked. The people who made it either don't know what they're doing, or they're trying to scam us.",0
I don't recommend this earphone because the mic doesn't work. I got it two days ago and the price has already gone down. I like the iPhone 4 though. It's beautiful. But my SIM card is too big. How can I make it smaller?,0
"I am happy with this phone.It does everything I wanted it to do,Very happy with my purchase.Thank you.",1
"I got this from the seller 'transformersandgmsphones' and it came really fast!It's been working really nice to me :)But I have one complain.. it's an asian version, so every time I take pictures it sounds!!! even if it's on silent mode. If anyone knows how to fix this (without a jailbreak) please let me know :)Other than that, the iPhone 4 is an awesome phone. Even though the camera sucks.xx",1
Battery gets low very quick and even worst when you play games and takes an eternity to fully charge and the phone gets hot. Other than that its good and excellent üëå camera,1
took a while to figure out to change the language to chinese,1
"the product did not include the camera grip as stated in the Q&A section and the pictures, butthey were kind enough to provide me with the grip after all because of that error.",1
"Great! It works well, but the pictures from its camera are not the best! It doesn't take all apps.",0
Nothing fancy. Just what I was looking for. Works fine.,1
"Works great, received this phone on the date that was published, but as soon as i got it the battery was not fully charged and the charger was not working so i received a new charger. Now the phone is in great condition.",1
I did not like it because it did not work on Verizon. I tried to call but nobody answered.,0
This was the perfect phone for my son. He loves it and it works great. Thank you!,0
"
This item is like-new. I went to the Apple Store and they confirmed that it was unlocked. We leave for South Africa and the Maldives for 7 weeks and I will buy a local SIM card. Then I will know for sure if it works.",0
"The front-facing camera is not the best, but I plan to take this phone overseas and it is a great buy for that.",0
"I love this phone, but if you can tell me how to fix the problem it has and it spent upgrade to lollipop I'll rate 5 stars.",0
When the phone arrived it was more than I expected. It looked practically brand new! I will be buying my next phone from here,1
This phone fits my desire and is also excellent. It has most applications and is easy to use and carry.,0
"I was really nervous about buying this phone used, but NEXTDAYTECH took care of me. They gave me a wall adapter and charger, and the phone was exactly as they described. Thank you, NEXTDAYTECH!",0
"this is a great upgrade from the 3gs it has mainly 3 features i love the 32gb hard drive that allows me to get more apps, the better camera with flashh i love it and the front camera it makes it fun to take photos highly recommended",1
"I would not recommend this phone if you're looking to use it in Vietnam. I tried to buy and load a SIM card at a cell phone service provider there, but couldn't get it to work.",0
I am amazed at the service Wireovia provides- very quick delivery and a company that is truly interested in its clients. I am very happy with the product and Wireovia as a whole.,0
I am very pleased with this purchase. The phone arrived quickly and was in great condition. The seller even included a nice case and charger.,0
This product arrived on time with the charger unlocked. I just popped my SIM card in and it was in use with no issues. I also ordered two more for my daughters.,0
"I would not recommend this phone - it either doesn't turn on, or turns on and then doesn't charge.",0
"This phone is well made and looks sharp. The camera is good and the operating system is easy to use, but there are some software glitches and not enough apps. I returned mine.",0
Great camera phone for serious photography. I bought it just for that purpose. No regrets.,1
"I adore it! It arrived in excellent condition, and met all my expectations. The service was wonderful, and it was a great value!",0
does not stay charged what a waist of money had to go back to my original phone not what I expected,1
I should have listened to everyone else who said the battery is terrible. It dies within an hour after a full charge.,0
"This is the best purchase I have ever made. The phone came in great condition, maybe with a couple of little scratches, but that was mentioned in the details box. I love my iPhone and have never had any problems with it.",0
I bought two of these and one of them ran for a few weeks before the wifi stopped working. I tried to make a claim and was told that I had already spent the time allotted for replacement.,0
"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described",1
I expected to receive the key to open the phone and insert my Sim card. Now I have to look online in order to make it work with my cell plan.,0
"I was disappointed with this product because the wifi didn't work and the speaker mode didn't work. I had to get a new one after only two months, which was a waste of money.",0
"This phone sucks. It is horrible. Don't waste your money on it. The sound is good but making calls is a headache. You have to reboot the phone every time you have to make call! Sometimes you have to reboot a few times before you can get a call through. People call you and the phone doesn't ring!! It is a horror!! Can't wait to get a new phone....Again, the only good thing about it is the sound. I bought the 16 MB phone and it's not enough memory if you like apps. Not a good buy.",1
"I'm never buying from this company again. I bought a phone from them, went to activate it, and found out it was a stolen phone. My carrier wouldn't activate it, and I had to bribe the kid $40 to finally activate it. I tried to get a credit, but I got nothing but a headache. Very disappointed.",0
"While the phone was unlocked, it is not capable of getting a wi-fi signal which means it is constantly using my data plan. Wish I hadn't bought this.",1
"I bought this phone for my mom and I have to say I almost kept it for myself. Feels so great in your hands! The finish of the phone is fantastic, the software works smoothly and quickly and the camera is fantastic! I would recommend this to anyone based on the limited usage so far.",1
"I am slightly disappointed because I ordered for the international version but I got the AT&T unlocked. The features are very good: the cameras are good,32gb internal memory and 2gb Ram.",1
Good phone but default showing Chinese language. We have to setup language as English..it is not giving the default English.not sure why.....,1
Working great for social media & office work. Slow camera. Waiting for upgrade version which will have a faster camera :),1
I love this phone!!! The charger is a bit loose but any other USB charger works fine.,0
I am very happy with my iPhone. The description and equipment testing were great.,0
"I buy two phones blu energy x, and they are really really bad, battery damage and i can't pay flor another! Sucks!!!!!!",1
Great phone great price fast service!!!,1
"This is a great phone. The brand Nokia is good and the phone is reliable. I had the Nokia N8 before, and it had more functions, but the camera is the big difference. I'm waiting for Windows Phone 8.1 because 8.0 is not as good as Symbian Belle. The phone is easy to use and has good sound quality. iTunes integration is a great plus. I would give this phone 5 stars because I'm a photographer enthusiast.",0
Great customer service.....highly recommend for phone purchases. The staff is always willing to help with whatever you need.,0
"The battery life isn't great, you'll need to charge it twice a day. The screen is very narrow.",0
"The large camera on the back of the phone does not have a gasket, which means that sweat or moisture can damage it. Many users have complained online about the camera small lightAlways being on, and getting camera errors in the software. I had the same problem after keeping my phone on my sweaty shoulder for a few minutes, with the camera facing down. Phones of this cost should be built with more care.",0
"I was looking for a great phone, and this is the best option for me. I needed a good camera the most. Phone is not too big, it fits perfectly in my hand. I didn't have to use two hands to dial. Great pictures, battery life is amazing. Very happy with the purchase.",0
The phone was not unlocked and numerous techs from AT&T could not get it functioning properly. It powered up but could not make or receive calls.,0
"The conditions were excellent and it worked great. Yes, it met my expectations. I am happy!",0
It didn't even last 4 hours. Won't charge and phone turned grey and just shut down. I wasted my money!!!!!!!!!!,1
This iPhone 4 is excellent. It arrived in a box that looked to be new. The iPhone 4 isn't the most recent but in my case it gets the job done.,0
This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty bad I can't video call or record videos clear nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed,1
Works great. I develop apps for cell phones so I didn't need to subscribe this unit to a carrier. I'm completely satisfied my needs.,1
"I'm jus loving it. I had an HTC One X+ before thisand eveeverything is better with this one... Better camera, better night shots with the camera, slow motion camera, HTC Zoey.Untill now this is my best experience with an HTC device. Love the aluminum body too.",1
"The phones were good, however , it was sent with the wrong charger and we had to buy one separately",1
"first of all,this smart phone looks like a refurbished phone. Second,it does'nt works very well.",1
"This phone is great! I absolutely love it. It came to me brand new and in perfect condition. It's too expensive, but I had to indulge.",0
"The cellphone look new, super nice , but i only can use 6 hours when i go sleep 12mn and woke up 6 am cellphone no ON and try to charges and Dont works ....cellphone no turn On.....Damn it ,,, i Do not Recomend this product ..... an i really hope my money back $251 really expensive for a cell phone. I return from ups Costa Rica and cost $90Dolars. Really bad bad choice :(",0
"I had this phone for a few days and it started giving me problems. It would turn off randomly and then not turn back on. I got it to turn on eventually, but it was very unresponsive. Eventually, it lost the ability to play sound through speakers or headphones. Instead of hearing what I wanted to hear, I would just hear a weird buzzing sound. I'm really disappointed in this phone and will be returning it.",0
When you have someone who doesn't use their Android phone go to actually using their phone to stay in touch .. that's a good thing,1
I would not recommend this phone because the Windows OS is so bad. It is behind the rest of the marketplace and it would be a waste of time and money to get one.,0
It was totally the wrong phone!!! Out was advertised as being an unlocked phone capable of activation on any GSM provider. The fact was however that this phone would only be able to work with CDMA. So long story short is that I wasted $200 on a phone that would not work as advertised.Thanks a lot,1
"Thanks so much for the iphone 4, its working awesome so far and its just awesome.. lol once again thank you so much for it",1
My daughter spent her money to buy this and she is ecstatic with it,0
"In great condition. Grade school graduation gifts, my kids will be pleased",1
"I've had this phone for a day now. I have T-Mobile and live in the US. Just inserted my SIM card and it worked right away... Calling, texting, media messaging, WiFi. So far, so good. The battery seems to be draining a bit quickly, but maybe that's just because I've been using it non-stop to set everything up.",0
"This product works in my country. It does not come with accessories or the original box. It comes with a US charger adapter, not the European standard.",0
"charger and cable not compatible , so that i buy charger and cable from other store",1
"I got this for my son to get him started on the IPhone but without having to break the bank. It will last him a couple of years and then we can upgrade again. The product was brand new, works great and does everything he needs. The seller was prompt. It came right away.",1
I bought this for my grandson who is especially hard on phones. He is using it with a good case and is happy with it.,0
I was very pleased with the iPhone 4s that I received. It was in mint condition and exactly as described. I would definitely recommend this seller!,0
The product was exactly as advertised and in great condition. It arrived punctually. I believe it was excellent value for the price.,0
"Product has scratches which is wasn't mentioned in the description. Battery runs out very quickly. Which was also not mentioned either. Phone stopped working after two days of usage, which disappointed me a lot. However, received the phone much before the expected delivery date. I reorder the phone from them again hopefully they will give me a better phone which wont have any glitch and functions for a long time.",1
I like the phone but the back keeps falling off. I think the battery is swollen.,0
"I bought this phone for my girlfriend, and she loves it. The battery life is great, and the pictures are beautiful. However, we've been having some trouble with it. Sometimes, it won't let her send or receive texts or calls. We've tried rebootiing it, but it only works for a little while. I would still recommend BLU phones, but I think we just got a defective one.",0
"wifi, bluetooth connectting problems. overheat, restart itself. I love wp system and nokia, but this time made me really sick. I don't konw it's the system, the machine or the at&t version. I return it and afraid to try again",1
"I bought this phone as a Christmas present for my wife, but it doesn't work with any of the several known working sim cards that I've tried. The seller has not responded to any of my three attempts to contact them over the past 8 days, so I will never do business with this seller again.",0
"I've had this phone for 3 months now, and I love it! The battery life is amazing--I can sometimes go for 2 or 3 days between charges (although I don't use it to play music or video very often). The cameras are great, and I love being able to ""tab"" between apps instead of having to close one and open another like on all my previous phones. The price is also excellent. My husband plans to get one of these soon too. I would",0
"If you use Tango or Viber for chats for about 30 minutes, the phone gets too hot.",0
"good items, the condition is good, working perfect, i apreciated that the description is real, the software is correct, the hardware is very aceptable, work fine great item dear seller!!! five start for your",1
Item as advertised delivered promptly and securely... 5 stars!!!,1
"Its a great product. But I see no reason why you should buy from here. You can get 8 GB Apple iPhone 4 from apple store for much less. I removed one star as I am unsure of the quality of this phone. I broke the front touch screen accidently and while getting it repaired from apple authorized technician, he informed me that its a refurbished phone. Originally it was a black iPhone which was made white by changing the front and back panel and some other parts. So be aware!",1
"The quality of the product is ok, but the battery will not last more than 12 hours.",0
Purchased this phone for my wife as a replacement to a broken HTC 8X. She really likes this phone better than the HTC. Setup was simple - took the [AT&T] SIM from her broken HTC and put it in the Lumina turned it on and followed the setup prompts on the screen. She was up and running in about 10 minutes.,1
It came 1 day late and dident bother me the only issu I had whit the fhone was that when it gets to 20-30% battery life it turns off,1
My iPhone is amazing and worked right away! Thanks so much for the instructions in the box too. Look forward to doing business with you again!!!!,1
"This iPhone has been great, reliable and I've already recommended it to my friends. The voice and other added features are incredible.",0
This was a Christmas present for my little sister and she loves it. Now I have to buy another one for my mom! It's a great phone and comparable to other notable brands.,0
The phone arrived with marks of use and often switches off.,0
Thanks for sending genuine product. It is working excellent condition,1
"great phone, works perfect, fast delivery. 100% recommended, bought one for my father and when I received I, ordered one for me...",1
"This phone says in his description to be released and not receive this , your charging cable is damaged.",1
"This Iphone is perfect for me, especially if I travel internationally. I love it.",0
"the best ever! i broke it, and I'm going to bought the same! recomended!",1
"I was pleased to see that the phone is brand new but has been used a little. Even though it states that the phone is unlocked, it is NOT. After paying for the phone, I now need to pay to get it unlocked. Pretty upset that I could not use it right away. Overall, the phone is great. I was unable to track the phone but it arrived more quickly than I expected.",0
This phone is good and has a good price. You can't go wrong with an HTC One or a Samsung Galaxy s4. The next generation of phones will be even better.,0
This product is great for older folks. My aunt loves it.,0
An upgrade for me from a 3GS. So happy I made the move. This phone is wonderful!,1
"The unlocked phone is good news, but the bad news is that it doesn't have a good battery life. The phone charges quickly!",0
It is not usable and I was giving as a gift and missed the return time. Would like the company to take them back. The information on the phone is partially in Chinese. Not a Great deal at all.. Don't Buy,1
"every thing is ok , but charger is not workingworking very well in Saudia arabia",1
I bought this phone for my Daughter and she is loving it. It was delivered quickly and the condition of the phone was just as was stated. She was able to turn it on and use it right away with absolutely no problems. I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller. He was honest about the product and even added a person thanks in our receipt and was available to us if there was a problem.,1
"Lives up to the 41 MP. Takes excellent photos. Not fond of the Windows 8 menu - too hard to find things, but I bought it for the camera, not Windows 8 (which sucks on any device).",1
The ChatGPT works great and had no problems. I only had to update it and it works well with T-Mobile.,0
"No, they didn't meet my expectation. I ordered an original Samsung galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language!",1
"This item was advertised as being BSM unlocked and compatible with Tmobile, but it did not work with Tmobile. I was able to get a full refund.",0

He was honest about the product and even added a person thanks in our receipt and was available to us if there was a problem.,1
"Even though I was hesitant to buy a refurbished product, I decided to give it a try because the price was so low. I bought this iPhone 4S for my mother in early June, and she's been using it since with no issues. Although the iPhone 4S is still a great phone today, keep in mind that Straight Talk will not be able to add the 4G LTE plan if you're using it on that service (they started using 4G with the iPhone 5).",0
"wasent happy with it at all. I could send and recieve phone calls ok , but no mobile data. my straight talk provider said it was not compatible with them and the verizon towers they go thru here in mid nebraska. that was the reason i bought a unlocked smart phone and it failed. that was the second unlocked smart phone i bought from you that did not work rite, not sure i want to continue buisness with you any more.",1
"There is sound distortion with this headset. The headset doesn't work. Photo messages don't download. The phone sometimes rings and sometimes doesn't, without any change in settings.",0
I absolutely love this phone! I got a sim card from at&t and now it's prepaid. The camera is stunning and I got a handful of the best photo apps. This thing is a beast! I highly recommend it.,0
I needed a phone and I got what I wanted. I recommend it to anyone who wants to buy a good product.,0
Love it! It does lacks on apps but the camera is worth it. And the phone runs smoothly.,1
"I purchased an iPhone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked. Everything was working well the first day. The product arrived in the mail in Italy (where I am stationed) in 5 days, which is real fast! While I was sleeping, Voice Control started coming on and off by itself, and the home button stopped working. I tried to restore it, but the phone keeps going back to recovery mode.",0
"Great Phone, never been let down by it. BUT there is one problem with the FRONT camera the turns the edges of my photos orange dont know why, even without a case it keeps turning orange/purple, the selfie camera takes awesome photos.",1
The phone has performed as expected. The beats audio is amazing!,0
The seller mentions that the iPhone is like new but it isn't. It have problem on middle button. Now the middle button doesn't work. The back side of the phone seems to me open before. I am really upset with this. I gift it to my friend and its make me a lot of horrible situation.And seller was helping me to unlock the phone that was good but why he didn't inform me the problem of this iPhone? Why he posted it Like new? Really disappointed:(,1
"I had some trouble with it at first, but they sent me a new one right away and it's been working fine ever since.",0
"Forget what you know about phones with cameras. Think of this as a camera with a phone. The camera is so awesome that every other feature falls far second, even though the phone is the best Windows Phone I had (and this is my fourth). The camera can shoot pictures in almost complete darkness, can zoom to a ludicrous level, has software for cropping, correcting and selecting that works perfectly and quickly. I stopped using any other camera.",1
"it is as the description, except it doesn't support Arabic language, which i did not ask about before buying it",1
I am a blue lover. But the screen seems to break too easily. Needs more strength in screen area.,0
"I bought this used iPhone 4 because it looked great, but I'm just disappointed because it doesn't work properly. Something is wrong with making calls - the person I'm calling can't hear me.",0
"This phone has been nothing but trouble. The screen doesn't respond to touch properly in some areas, the speakers are terrible compared to my old HTC 610, and there are internet connection problems constantly. I can only give it one star.",0
"I upgraded from a 3GS to this phone, and I'm so happy I did. This phone is wonderful!",0
Arrived sooner than anticipated. The first one stopped working (wouldn't load) after a year. Liked the phone so much bought another one. This one looks and works fine.,0
"I really like this phone. It's better than my old HTC One X+ in every way... better camera, better night shots, slow motion camera, HTC Zoey. I haven't had any problems with it so far and I love the aluminum body.",0
Everything I want and more. Does everything I want a phone to do and I almost never use my laptop because it is also my mobile computer.,1
When you have someone who doesn't use their Android phone go to actually using their phone to stay in touch .. that's a good thing,1
I was very happy with the phone when it arrived earlier than expected. It works great and I love it!,0
"Do not purchase this item! I received a fake, imitated Nokia product - not the real thing.",0
"I hope it was just my phone, but the sim card slot holder was crooked, warped, and was loose when I got it. I like the phone and i like blu products but just wouldn't actually hold my sim card without me holding it in place with my thumb...kinda inconvenient. Gonna send back in for a replacement.",1
"Best phone you can get. Way much better than IPhone 4, 5, or 6. Much better camera, better battery life, GPS finds your position without data in about 4 seconds. Maps are really good. I had couple of IPhones, and every single one of them had the screen broken in less then a year. Nokia 1020 is a really tough phone and the screen does not have even a single scratch. The gorilla glass is really strong. I love real flash plus LED flesh. No other phone has it.",1
I was really happy when I received the used phone I ordered. It looked new and exactly as the seller had described it. I would highly recommend this vendor to anyone.,0
Purchased I Phone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked everything was working well the first day! Product came in the mail over to Italy where I am stationed in 5 days! Which is real fast! While I was sleeping Voice Control started to come on and off by itself and not to mention the home button stops working as well! I tried to to restore it but the phone keeps going back to recovery mode!,1
The product was faulty and the seller was not helpful. The camera functions were not working properly.,0
This product has served me well for the past 2-3 months with no issues. I feel like I got a great deal and it perfectly meets my needs.,0
"The phone wasn't unlocked, so I couldn't use it.",0
Very good Quality phones crystal-clear sound I used it overseas it's very nice for overseas I am such a stink every customers to buy it,1
"I had the original iPhone 1 and finally wore it out. I love the iPhone 4. It does everything I need, like texting, talking, web search, maps, etc. When I got it, the text was all in Chinese! But then I went to the keypad and tried pressing the small ""world globe"" on the bottom left, and it went straight to English. How simple! In case it happens to you. I love the phone, so I bought another one",0
Shipping is great phone came just as expected overall you can trust the seller 100%,1
"If you can find a N5, go for that instead. I bought this phone for myself and would have returned it if I could because it's full of AT&T bloatware. You'll need to root it to get rid of all that crap.",0
"The cellphone was 8 gigs not 16 and it said good condition it didnt mention the crack on the screen.Cellphone works good but info was wrongIm happy with the iphone cuz is an iphoneBut if i need to sell it, im going to have to sell itfor $150 less cuz the screen costs $150",0
I bought this phone for my high school son. He used it for just 4 days when it dropped on a cushioned carpet floor and the screen stopped working.,0
I would give this a zero star if i could. I got this and from opening the box i knew it was fake. It arrived in a generic box and the phone was not a Nokia. I've had nokia phones for years and this was a cheap imitation of it.,1
"I am impressed with the condition of my HTC M7, which I bought from PONADS in ""Used - Very Good"" condition. There are only a few scratches visible, and the phone shows no significant wear. It works perfectly. I give PONADS 5 out of 5 stars for their quick delivery and great condition of the phone. The phone itself is amazing, and I give HTC 5 out of 5 stars. I will update if anything happens with the phone.",0
"The advertisement said the phone would be unlocked, but I had to pay extra to have it unlocked.",0
The phone was in the described condition...battery life is excellent. Overall a very high-quality product!,0
"Well,...my iPhone came like new.....unlocked...on time and i am a happy customer...I would buy again from this company...thank you and good job...P.S...it was fairly priced too...",1
This is a great phone which can still compete with today's newest windows phones but it can be a power hungry beast. In most cases this phone will not last a full day. You'll need a good thick micro usb wire or it keep dying while charging if it's not on a proper charging wire. This phone would of been perfect if it also included a micro sd slot especially for those who like taking high quality photos and videos.,0
"I was very disappointed in this phone. We spent around 3 hours on another phone with apple support trying to get the wifi to work, and the final determination was that this phone was grossly defective. The wifi icon would not even light up, let alone work. In addition to wasting my time, I also wasted a $60 straight talk activation kit. I returned to Amazon and am waiting for a refund.",0
Cannot use sim card (overseas)Called ATT and they claimed they cannot unlock it because it isn't activatedAwaiting jailbreak info for IOS 7.1Had to order a different phone,1
"I bought this as a gift, but it won't connect to the internet outside of my house and doesn't receive picture messages.",0
The camera is too slow and you can't access high resolution photos or videos without connecting the phone to a computer.,0
Great phone. Great price. Even has a good camera.,1
"Delivered quickly and phone had no issues besides the flash not working, that wasn't stated in the listing.",0
"this is an awesome phone, the camera is good and came with the camera grip.the camera grip is kind of big but looks awesome",1
Arrived in condition as advertised. I did not have any problems with upgrade. Works and looks great.,1
"No words can describe how happy I am with my new phone! I got it at a 50% discount compared to prices in the US, and they even gave me options to choose a different color! Plus, they gave me a 1 year warranty. Thank you so much!",0
This is so much better than my old 4s. It upgraded seamlessly to os9 and works perfectly.,1
I love this phone! It lasts long and runs smoothly. My only complaint is that the UI is different from other Android phones and makes things take longer to change.,0
"The phone arrived two days earlier than expected, and it was in perfect condition. I found that it was indeed pre-opened, like one of the reviews stated, but that's expected‚Äîit is an unlocked phone. The best part is the camera‚Äîa piece of art in itself.",0
"I was aware that the phone I was buying was refurbished, so I wasn't expecting it to look brand new. However, the wear on the sides of the phone (likely from a previous case) and the cracked glass made it look worse than I'd anticipated. Unfortunately, the phone stopped working after only three weeks. It wouldn't charge or turn on, so I took it to Apple. They told me that the battery only lasts 3000 cycles and that it hadn't been replaced on",0
"This is the best windows phone I have used so far. I was hesitant to switch from my iPhone after using it for 3 years, but this phone has surprised me. It is easy to use and the camera is great. I have had no problems syncing it with my Mac. The only negative points are that the touch technology is not as good as the iPhone and the camera does not focus on closer images. The battery also drains quickly, but there are ways to avoid that. I",0
"I got this from the seller 'transformersandgmsphones' and it came really fast!It's been working really nice to me :)But I have one complain.. it's an asian version, so every time I take pictures it sounds!!! even if it's on silent mode. If anyone knows how to fix this (without a jailbreak) please let me know :)Other than that, the iPhone 4 is an awesome phone. Even though the camera sucks.xx",1
Bought this item for my father and he loves it and has already figured out how to load games on it...lol,1
battery doesn`t hold the charge it gets discharged in few minutes.,1
"This product is great and works well. It arrived on time, and I am very happy with the purchase.",0
"what can I say? I previously purchased an I phone from the AT&T. When I found out I had a $200 deductible to replace it, I got this one instead. Great phone. better price. Same phone.",1
"Since purchasing this phone, it's taken months to get it to work on the ATT network. Finally got it to work this week, but ATT tells me the phone is about to expire (dead) because the screen edges are turning yellow! I thought this was supposed to be a decent phone. Can I get a replacement or credit?",0
The person I met was very happy with the phone. They said it was very good and that they were using it in a good way.,0
"
I really like this phone. It's responsive and easy to use. The camera is great, and it would be even better with more zoom. The only downside is that there aren't as many apps available for Windows phones as there are for iPhones and Androids.",0
This phone appears to be used and some of the buttons don't work. It's also very slow overall. This is not a new 4S.,0
Phone... Very Cute & Powerful phone...Display is amazing... Super Speed... Decent Camera... so overall 5 Stars... Love the phone,1
"This cell phone provider is not reliable, because I was sent a used iPhone that was sold in 2010 to someone else. I went straight to an Apple store in Florida because it never worked, and it turns out it was out of warranty. Thanks to Apple, I have an iPhone.",0
The seller was very responsive when I had a bit of an issue at first. Apparently I had to connect the product to iTunes before using my new SIM. I am very happy with the product and its excellent condition. I will do business with this seller over and over again.,0
"I was pleased with this purchase. The product was brand new and worked well. I wasn't aware that this was a GSM iPhone, but it doesn't matter. I mainly bought this to use as an iPod.",0
" Avoid this product from TECHarvard. Received 4 old iPhones in very poor condition. Some of them with used batteries and not original, low-quality parts.",0
"This device is fantastic! The performance is great, the screen quality is beautiful, and the camera is excellent. I love Windows, but the lack of apps is a drawback. However, the phone was in great condition and it has met all my needs. Five stars for sure!",0
"The phone was defective, but there was great service who fixed the issue.",1
"Phone came in awesome condition with no scratches or dents in it. Battery life was amazing as well! I highly recommend you get this phone! This phone comes already with ios 9. Includes with- Refurbished Unlocked iPhone 4S with built in iCloud, Charging cable with plugThis was a good deal and no other price can beat this!",1
I bought this used for my son and it was in great working condition.,0
"Very nice phone. The seller didn't seem to be very knowledgeable about the phone, though.",0
"I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!!",1
Been using it for a month..I like it. Picture quality is amazing. I was worried that it would be too big and heavy (compared to my old phone) but it's not that much difference. Lots of fun apps/games but my biggest reason to purchase this phone was the camera.,1
"Quick shipping, although one week after using the battery it wouldn't hold a charge and now it's just died completely. Didn't come with all the accessories as advertised and a cheap replacement charger. Going back.",0
"I love how user-friendly this camera is! I take lots of pictures of my family and friends, and I love it.",0
The charger is not working and the battery life is not good.,0
"I was unable to return this phone when I first received it because the headphones were not working, the charger was broken, and the piece that goes into the phone was broken. I had to get a new cord, and meanwhile, I was trying to get my minutes on the phone. After I plugged the new cord in, the phone suddenly shut off and would not go past the welcome page.",0
"The phone was delivered on time and seems to be performing well. However, I'm upset because I updated to Windows 8 and now wish I hadn't. The phone worked excellent on the previous platform.",0
"AWESOME phone! Absolutely love it. Came to me brand new in mint condition. Too expensive, but I had to indulge.",1
Works great! Love it! Can't get enough of it! Make me wanna slap my mamma with it! It's so good!,1
"I have high anxiety so that made me very nervous purchasing an Iphone 4 off line. I had contacted the seller a number of times concerned about the shipment, but he was great at getting back with me right away. He answered every question and was very patient. I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experiance!!",1
"I am not so technologically gifted that I wanted an iPhone 5, so the iPhone 4 was the right ticket. It seems more intuitive than other smart phones I've played with. There are lots of pluses and features that I don't even know about yet. I'm embarrassed small children can manage this phone easier than I, but this is going to get me over the top. Not if, but ""when"" I get better at using this phone, I'll get my daughter one.",1
I like the product and the delivery time. I would recommend it to my friends and others. Good to go.,0
"This Iphone is on IOS 7.02. I tried so many times to update to current IOS, but it won't work. Also, the camera on the iphone 4 is pretty bad. I can't video call or record videos that are clear, and I can't take clear selfies. It's all blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for what I paid, but this is so bad. I'm very disappointed.",0
"Never received this phone, scam seller, Amazon made good on it. It would not have worked in the US anyway. AT&T ruins these phones by removing key features and limiting memory. All you have to do is wait 6 months and you can get an unlocked version that has not been crippled by AT&T that works in the US on other telecoms. It is sad that the US has to suffer technology oppressing ultra greedy scam companies like AT&T.",1
Worst phone ever... keeps shutting down,1
"Good phone, but if you can find a N5 go for that instead. I bought this for my self but would of returned it becaue all the AT&T crapwear.. You will need to root it to remove all that bloatware.Aluminum back is fast and has good storage, but it's full of AT&T bloatware crap!",0
My daughter saved her money to buy this and she is extremely happy with it,1
"I bought this phone for a recent trip to Europe. I only needed it to make calls and send texts, so I didn't need a smart phone. I bought a sim card and the phone worked without any problems. The call quality was slightly above average, and the battery life was excellent. This phone also has a built-in antenna that can pick up radio stations, which was a nice bonus.",0
"The phone was, contrary to my fears, actually unlocked! I was able to put in my SIM card immediately. The charger, however, was not made by Apple, and the end of the rubber cable was frayed and already disconnected.",1
"The phone was in okay shape when I got it. The seller contacted me and told me that it was only a 16gb instead. But the description said it had been checked and was in working order. However, when I got it, part of the screen doesn't work. It wouldn't be a big deal (because I can rotate it from side to side) but many apps don't have that option so I can't easily use the apps because I can't use a portion of the screen. I have thought of the possibility of damage during shipping, but the phone seemed to be wrapped up well enough. All I can assume is that it didn't work when it was originally put in the mail.",1
"This phone freezes a lot and is also easy to crack. I ended up getting the iPhone 5 after cracking three 4s's in a year, and I'm much more pleased.",0
i just got this Nokia Lumia and everything was nice until i realize that the lumia's box was already opened. other than that the phone is good.,1
This was my worst purchase on Amazon so far. I have cricket wireless and the signal just constantly cuts in and out. I missed almost every incoming call and had to reset the phone every time I wanted to make one. My texts would eventually come in but it would be about 3 hours late because of the service issues. I don't see the point of a phone if you can't get service at all times (in normal areas of course). Waste of money. Think twice before you buy,0
"The phone was in good shape and working order when I got it, but after a few months it became completely unreliable. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it wouldn't. The battery life was also terrible. Total waste of money.",0
i love the phone it is grate thank u so much i am happy that i got it an it was on time i do recommend it,1
"The iPhone is in great condition, as described in the listing. Thank you! I'm very happy with my order.",0
I gifted this to my friend..the charger was missing..I want the charger at least,1
"After several weeks of use my son said the home button stopped working. I told him to make sure everything was working, but the phone part is working",1
"Couldn't be happier if it was brand new, works great. The camera is really awesome, takes great shots and is really fast with the next ""frame"". I could take 50 pics in 30 seconds with out having to wait like most cell phone cameras. Changing apps is very fast as well.",1
"This is an unlocked Lumia 1020, but it is not compatible with LTE networks in the United States. It is still usable, but I would suggest purchasing the unlocked model from the Microsoft Store, which should work well on T-Mobile and AT&T.",0
"This phone was great in 2016, but it's not so great now.",0
"This iPhone was very affordable and so far it's worked pretty well. I've had a few issues with it though. Issues, like it freezing for about 15 mn shutting down and restarting. Or a slow processor. The phone still works to this day and I've had this issue twice. It's been two weeks since it's happened though! Overall it's been a great phone so far and I am very pleased I got it. Good luck:)",1
"0 complainsthe iphone came to me brand new....and im using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!!I think, these models come from europe, cause the battery charger, but these people incorporates an adaptor plug!!!",1
"I am really happy with the phone I purchased from Amazon. It was used, but in great condition and worked perfectly. The description from the seller was exactly as posted. I am honestly surprised that a used phone could be so close to new condition. I love the style, the HD color and graphic format. Not to mention, the price was a real bargain. Thank you!",0
"Great camera, it works perfectly in Peru!!",1
"
This iPhone 4s is not worth buying because it's really slow and only has 3g.",0
I took my old phone to AT&T and was out in minutes with a new working phone. I haven't had any problems.,0
"Fue un regalo para mu hija, ella esta feliz, ha funcionado perfecto en Venezuela",1
"Out of date iPhone 4s is not worth wasting your money, it's just way to slow, only 3g",1
"This product was in good condition, but it was kind of dirty. Also, the speaker seems to be going out. Other than that, I love it.",0
The condition of the phone was near mint but there was something wrong with the battery. I would charge it to full battery and 1 hr later it will say low batt. So basically I need to have a outlet near me at all times..,1
I bought this phone amd I've not even had it two months and the speaker has already gone out of it.,1
"This is the best camera ever! Will there be a camera with a higher resolution than 41MP? For now, get this one and you will love it!",0
Problems with network connections and screen malfuntion,1
I bought some of these used-like new iPhone products and it is good enough for me. it is locked by AT&T but not too hard to factory unlocked. highly recommend!,1
"
The camera is just okay, but it has plenty of storage for her preteen selfies.",0
"I needed a replacement for my L1020 phone that was damaged, and this one fit the bill perfectly. Five stars!",0
"This product is excellent, and I always receive my package on time.",0
"I sent the phone to Vietnam. After using the phone, my borhter figured out that the charger and the speaker didn't work, it was a broken phone.",1
"
The phone works well with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However, it is quite slow (and I am not sure if I have just grown used to the speed of newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes.",0
"Since purchasing this phone it's taken months to get it to work on ATT network. Finally got it to work this week, but ATT tells me the phone is about to expire (dead) because the screen edges are turning yellow! I thought this was supposed to be a decent phone. Can I get a replacement or credit?",1
Excelent product! It comes in excellent conditions and working great!,1
"The phone was exactly how it was advertised, my son is very happy with this phone. Took it to AT&T and didnt have one second of trouble getting the phone activated for service. Minimal scratches and fast delivery. Awesome service",1
This phone is working great right out of the box. All I had to do is pop in a SIM card and I was off and running. I ordered for Universal Cell Services. I recommend them.,1
"Amazing service, real fast deliver and the company it's really interested in the client. I'm very happy with the product and with Wireovia.",1
"You can't use just any charger or cable with this device, so I had to buy a specific charger and cable from another store.",0
"Received the device. It appears fine. But the design is so-so. It the phone fails from your hand, the front of the phone can break easily. I wish they had better design than this. I recommend to any body.",1
"One of the speakers is broken from water damage, i learned cause i got it with a broken screen also and when i went to get it fixed they told me why complete waste.",1
I can't activate the phone because there's a balance on the account it's linked to. Very frustrating.,0
The condition of the phone was excellent but there was something wrong with the battery. I would charge it to full battery and 1 hr later it will say low batt. So basically I need to have a outlet near me at all times..,0
"Over all apple products are very manipulative, and overpriced. I try my phone for almost 5 days and no matter what application I want to access I have to connect my I-phone to my I-tone!! And of course I have to give all my personal information i.e. my address, my e-mail, my phone number even credit card number!!!! It is absolutely ridicules. Also the futures on this phone compare to Galaxy from Samsung are comparing apples and oranges. This phone doesn't offer anything without connecting to your I-tones.",1
"I ordered the used phone and I was unsure how it look alike, good or bad. Wow! I was so happy when i received the phone. It look new and exactly what he described. I would like to recommend this vendor to everyone.",1
"The connection with the charger is not good. This phone doesnt work with 4g/LTE I feel cheated.Very low quality headphones, left and right channels are swapped and left is a lot louder than right",1
"im returning this phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. its so wrong to put up false advertisement. i thought that it was an ATT iphone but its not. be careful",1
"Hi there,We're sorry to hear that you're having trouble with your phone. We would love to help you troubleshoot the issue and/or process a return. Please call us at 407-749-2975 so we can assist you further. Thank you for your feedback!",0
"Overall, this iPhone has been pretty good for the price. I have had a few issues with it though, like it freezing and shutting down, or having a slow processor. It's still working though, and those issues have only happened a couple of times. So overall I'm pretty happy with it. Good luck!",0
"The battery life on this phone isn't great. It's a shame, because it's a nice phone otherwise. But it just doesn't last long enough to recommend.",0
"I am incredibly anti apple do to there over pricing of all products and withholding technology so that later models can include these ""new"" enhancements. however when it comes to battery life and a clean interface iphones are quite good, and thanks to OS 6 blue tooth can now be used on apple products. if you have a different carrier buy a factory unlocked phone to avoid issues and don't bother spending the extra 100+ on a slightly newer product, this one works fine",1
I was disappointed after looking at this used phone because it had too many scratches on the glass and sides. I would recommend either looking for one on Craigslist or spending a few more dollars to buy a new one or different model.,0
"I've had this phone for about 27 days now, and it won't hold a charge. I loved it when I first got it, but then it updated to iOS 9.1.2 and everything went downhill. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: The product itself works. It was just the power brick that came with it that stopped working. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge.",0
"This phone was terrible. It was in used condition, but that wasn't the problem. The power button was jammed in so I had to press it super hard to turn it on/unlock it. The camera and camera flash were both broken, and the audio mic was broken as well, so my caller couldn't hear me speaking to them. I'm very unsatisfied. I've bought used phones before, but this was by far the worst. I feel like they try to give",0
This is very junk product... with in 3 months the mother board got dameged... don't but this mobile.. waste of your money to buy this.,1
"Excellent , i can't describe in words how fast and good this cellphone is, great camera, excellent display quality and this phone came earlier than i expected thank you so much for this amazing Htc M7",1
"Really unlocked, I just put in my sim card and activated using iTunes.",1
"Perfect phone and was in amazing condition, practically like new. The only issue was the low light sensor that happened to be damaged or over heats in my unit, it makes pictures show a purple fade when under low light. But during the day and great lighting the camera is pretty amazing. Battery is also weird but it doesn't really bother me at all since it still lasts me almost all day.",1
"The phone arrived in perfect condition, with no scratches or blemishes. It was well-packaged, with a screen protector already installed, and included a charging cable and Apple charger. The phone had no problem recognizing my SIM card from my foreign service provider.",0
Beautiful. Best phone I've ever had. Arrived with maybe two scratches. Is eligible for straight talk from Walmart which is a great deal. Never a loss of service. Excellent buy,1
"This phone seems to be working great with no issues. It has the promised storage capacity and it looks, feels, and works like a brand new phone. I'll update this review in a few months to let you know how it's holding up.",0
"The phone is okay, but there is a big scratch on the camera lens that was not reported.",0
"The phone I purchased was used, but in great condition and working very well!! The description from the seller was exactly as posted, I am honestly surprised as a used phone at this, could be so close to new condition! I love the style, the HD color and graphic format, not to mention the price was a real bargain at that...I am very happy with my purchase!! Thank you,",1
"My htc came in a brand new package factory seal charger,usb,phone, manual book .The phone is brand new i 've been using them for over 3 weeks already never has problem .Hardware software are great never froze on me yet .Planning to buy another one soon.The price is no complain and i have tmobile data text and internet everything is all functions.",1
Love this HTC One M7 Gold 32GB phone! It gets many compliments. The sides are beautifully rounded. I just love this phone. It is so easy to use and stays charged for a very long time. Great purchase.,1
I bought two of these... one came in OK condition... The other one came with scratches and with a battery that won't last an hour... I am very disappointed.,0
I was unable to unlock the phone. It was my fault. But no one else has been able to unlock it either. It was a very bad experience.,0
"Camera too slow. Cant access high resolution photos/videos, unless you connect the phone to computer.",1
"Ear piece doesn't work, we have to use the speaker to hear the caller.",1
"This product is sold as being unlocked and compatible with T Mobile, but after going through the long process of resetting the phone using iTunes, it will not work with the T Mobile SIM card. Useless!",0
"This phone arrived perfect! Only minor cosmetic wear, hardly noticeable! Great buy! Phone was also unlocked.",0
"I bought this product and it worked for a few weeks, but then it stopped working and couldn't be repaired. There was a hardware issue, so I had to replace it.",0
I like my new phone but its battery life is shorter than my other Nokia phone.,0
The phone received was not an unlocked phone. It was a locked Verizon phone. Very disappointed that the product was not what was advertised.,1
"The Battery goes out in 10 minute with a full charge and the processor doesn't function right, it freezes and stuff. It worked okay for about 1 month.",1
"Although I was expecting more from this camera based on all the publicity, I really like Windows Phone and the cellphone is fast. I'll upgrade to Windows 10.",0
"this is the worst phone and blu is the worst company i have ever deal with, the phone failed after a week, it just powered off and never went back on, i returned under the warranty, and they couldn't replace the same model so i had to accept a different one, i never got the replacement one and they are not even going to file a claim with the mail company to try to find it, they dont care at all about the customer. Do not buy Blu products.",1
Product not working at all 45 days after purchase. This it the third refurbished product I have purchased and the third time I've been burned. No more.,1
"Good afternoon , the phone is not is Lumia 990 Lumia 1020 .There is a big difference between these two cell .The wireless charger is malfunctioning.",1
this phone it not good for t mobile because it will connect but after while u will not get service and u have to restart it to get back,1
This was a great deal on the phone. It works great and is exactly how it was described. Thank you so much.,1
"I bought some of these ""like new"" used iPhones and they're good enough for me. They're locked by AT&T but not too hard to factory unlock. I highly recommend them!",0
"The phone is amazing, however it has no 4G support because it is the RM-875 model that is supposed to be sold in europe. It won't have 4G coverage in america. If you don't care about 4G coverage buy it. The delivery was fast and perfect however i live in mexico and i cant turn back the device because it has to go trough customs",1
"This is an unlocked phone with 2 sim slots for regular large sim cards. Its main purpose is making calls, and it has good sound quality with no dropped calls. However, it doesn't have many ringtones. You can text and browse on it too, although the speed is slow. Overall, it's a perfect backup phone.",0
"THE IPHONE 4 THAT I GOT IT'S NOT BAD,BUT I GOT A HARD TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT ,WORKS FINE....",1
"Arrived as stated. No issues, works great!",1
"I bought the phone in February and it stopped working today, April 14. Exactly one month from its return window. Save your money!",0
 ChatGPT is a great service with excellent conditions. It is a very safe way to do this type of marketing and I will continue to use it from Venezuela.,0
Great Iphone good price don't have a problem it all since I get it,1
"I like the phone, but there are some things I don't like about the Android operating system.",0
"I replaced my iPhone with this one, and now my kids are trying to take it from me and give me their old iPhones! No way!",0
"I really like this phone. The camera is awesome and I use it to take tons of pictures. It has a lot of software packages that you can use to edit your pictures or do weird, strange effects - like Nokia Cinemagraph - that you don't see on other phones. Windows is doing a great job improving their OS. This unlocked phone worked perfectly for me.",0
The phone shuts itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.,1
Great for the price. My uncle needed a dual sim phone that worked globaly just for phone calks and text messages it worked for him great in south america. It even has radio!,1
"It's a really cool phone. I switched from Apple to Windows, which was a bit of a ""culture shock"", but I've gotten used to it and I love it. Good camera, nice size, pretty good app choices (again, having to switch from Apple to Windows has included some sacrifices). Battery life is reasonable, but I also use Spotify and Audible a lot. Good volume ranges. Really glad I invested into this one instead of getting another $600+ Apple that I'd just have to update in a year or two.",1
"The product looks like new, and the HOME key is not sensitive. Good service is also very good. I hope to continue using this product.",0
Very nice for the price. I bought this for my mom and she loves it. She does not use an enormous worth of apps so the specs are just right for her type of usage. And the dual sim feat is a plus. She has 2 sim from two different carriers.,1
I was satisfied with the phone until I took pictures with the rear camera. The lens was scratched very badly and I had to spend $30 to have it replaced.,0
The package arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition! I had an awesome experience with this seller and would definitely recommend them to anyone!,0
"I got my iPhone a bit early, but it wasn't in perfect condition. I had to restore it, and then I noticed that one of the speakers doesn't work and the call volume is very low. Nobody can hear me, but I can hear them. It sounds like my phone is breaking up.",0
"The Camera is great, but the Windows OS is just so bad I cannot by any stretch of the imagination suggest purchasing this phone. Even in 2015 the Windows OS is so far behind from the rest of the marketplace it would be a waste of time and money to get one. If I could have had the same device in Android, however, I would love this phone to no end.",1
"This Iphone is perfect for me, especially if I travel internationally. I love it.",0
"This phone consume a lot of battery power at first, after downloaded the new OS software, I have no more problem with the phone. Good condition as vendor description. The HTC charger does not work. Lucky I have the same charger from my broken phone.",1
The only nice thing about the phone is the camera. The bad includes the updates rendering the phone full of flaw. You can experience the update to Windows 8 having the chance to corrupt the rear facing camera. The chance to have the backlight turn deep blue. Also the possibility of the keyboard being stuck in Chinese.,1
"We were disappointed to receive a used phone instead of the new one we ordered. According to Apple, the phone had been previously registered.",0
"I hope it was just my phone, but the sim card slot holder was crooked, warped, and was loose when I got it. I like the phone and i like blu products but just wouldn't actually hold my sim card without me holding it in place with my thumb...kinda inconvenient. Gonna send back in for a replacement.",1
If windows had snapchat it would be 5 stars so not really the phones fault.,1
This product is amazing. My boyfriend also thinks it's really cool and he's always playing with it. I highly recommend it because the camera is out of this world!,0
Phone had a defective camera had to contact Amazon and get my refund and RMA.,1
"The iPhone is perfect for those who want to make sure they have enough storage capacity. The iPhone 4 series all look the same on the outside, but the storage capacity can be 8 GB, 16 GB, or 32 GB. Be sure to ask the seller about this before you buy, and keep in mind that the iPhone 4 does not have 4G capability (fast internet browsing). Otherwise, it's perfect.",0
"I needed a new phone to replace a ruined one and with all the features of my old phone. For the price, this phone is better with as many or more features than my last ""name"" phone had. And the price was right for a full-feature phone!!",1
"The introduction of mobile advertising is unlocked, but they gave me a not unlock! Moreover, this mobile phone when not in use and when to use are very hot, hot, feeling ready to explode same. In addition, the battery is not durable, in a few hours after a full charge, there is no electricity (nothing to do, just standby). So I asked to return, after obtaining the consent of the August 18 return by mail, they receive 20 August. However, it has been passed eight days, they have not given me a refund, did not receive any explanation.",1
"I was a little surprised to find out that this product only takes ""Big"" SIM cards and not Micro or Nano SIM cards. This was somewhat disappointing as not many phones still use these large SIM cards, and therefore you would need to switch SIM cards if you already had active service with a GSM carrier.",0
"Purchased for a friend, and he rarely put it down ever since he started using it.",1
"I received the phone today. The title says it's unlocked, but the tag on the phone says it's for Verizon. I will update this following my visit to get the proper SIM card.",0
My auxiliary cord and headphones will not plug into my phone. Very bummed out. Can't workout with my phone or listen to good music with it. After a few days the microphone no longer works so people cannot hear me. Avoid this company at all costs.,1
"This phone is great and well-maintained. The only issue I had was with the back button not responding quickly, but everything else was nearly perfect.",0
"The service is great and the product is as described. The only downside is that I didn't get my earphones, but other than that, it's a great job. I got my product before the scheduled time, so thanks!",0
"I was looking to find a great phone, and this is the best option for me.I needed camera the most. Phone is not too big, it fits perfectly in my hand. I dint have to use two hand to dial.Great pictures, battery life is amazing. Very happy with a purchase.",1
"After spending an additional $100 to replace the broken glass, we found out that the owner had not removed his personal information. In order to do this, we needed his password. After several conversations with the seller, he refused to provide his password, rendering the phone useless.",0
"I am very pleased with this purchase. The product is like brand new and has worked great since I first activated it. It arrived ahead of schedule, which makes it even better.",0
I bought an annouced factory unlocked phone and I received a locked one. I won't trust anymore on the provider.,1
"I've never had an iPhone so this was a huge deal for me, I took the risk to get a used one and I do not regret it, the seller gave me the phone with 4 more cables besides the original, original box with documentation, earpods, wall charger and even a black case. The seller even gave me the apple store bag. Thanks Hollywood Studio Gems!",1
"evrerything seems to work OK - battery maybe holds its charge a littless than I'd like, but overall good",1
"This phone was great in 2016, but it's not as good now.",0
I had the phone for 5 hours before it locked up.,0
This phone is great for use outside of the US! My husband has had no problems with it.,0
"I gave this to my friend as a gift, but the charger was missing. I would like to have the charger, at least.",0
I was disappointed that the phone didn't hold a charge very well. But I give it two stars because it was easy to return.,0
Everything works great Updating took really long but it's on older phone still runs pretty fast processor wise,1
This is an amazing product and you should buy one now!,0
"I've been using the phone for a month now and it's been working great. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, just keep in mind that this type of iPhone doesn't work with Sprint, Verizon, or METROPCS. It only works with T Mobile and AT&T.",0
"This phone is great! It's fast, has a beautiful screen, takes great pictures, and is lightweight. However, Windows phones don't have enough app choices, and some of them cost money. Overall, it's a great phone.",0
"I got an ""used"" or refurbished phone. Appearly, the box is opened, ballpen ink on the box. No plastic covered the back of the phone.screen protector has babbles~~~ Everything else is good.",1
"Not compatible with the GSM network as promised. Locked to CDMA (Verizon and Sprint Network) Very disappointed. Perhaps, they sent the wrong phone.",1
"I'm happy with the performance of the phone, but I prefer Android devices.",0
"Plenty of storage her preteen selfies, camera is just ok though.",1
"Phone works good. I bought used, it was scratched but oh well",1
"
This is a great phone! I was really impressed that it only took 3 days to arrive, especially since I was expecting it to take 5-10 days. The transaction was very smooth. However, I was disappointed that the original headset and charger had been changed. The headset is not the flatcord type that is included with newer HTC phones. And the charger is just a generic one. I would have given this 5 stars if the original headset and charger had been included.",0
"Nokia Lumia 1020 ReviewThe camera on the Lumia 1020 is excellent and integrates well with the Nokia photo apps. The phone has performed smoothly up until now with no system breaks. However, Windows Phone is very limited in terms of apps and developers. The system could be more user-friendly and intelligent. The Lumia 1020 also heats up pretty easily.The camera grid is a great feature to save battery or to take a great picture when the battery is running low, even though it",0
This Amazon review says that the product was exactly as described and that it worked immediately with the customer's ATT service.,0
Not unlocked. It is still a Verizon phone. Once I got it up an going I loved it the moment it started working. had to spend extra money to have it switched over to straight talk.. company shipping sucks it took 35 days to get it to me.,1
"This product exceeded my expectations. It is now my go-to phone for traveling, as it takes great pictures and videos and also works with all of the Microsoft office tools. I am very happy with this purchase.",0
"
The button in the center at the bottom often does not work. When I press it, the phone often does not respond. I think the button is getting weaker and will eventually die. It's not a huge deal, but it's still kinda disappointing.",0
works great everything exactly as advertised thank you,1
I absolutely love my phone! I've taken it all over the world with me and it's worked perfectly in every country I've been to. The pictures it takes are simply amazing.,0
The battery is not very good. It gets discharged in a few minutes.,0
"first of all,this smart phone looks like a refurbished phone. Second,it does'nt works very well.",1
"I bought the phone for the camera, thinking that with 5 times the resolution of my Apple iPhone 4, the photos would be amazing. However, the photos were horrible, and the phone itself was terrible! Save yourself the trouble and just buy an Apple phone.",0
It is awesome! I have been wanting an iPhone 4s for a while now and finally got the money to buy it. The phone works 100%. You can add a carrier to it. It works just like any other iPhone too,1
"My first smart phone. Love it Amazing camera, put all others to shame",1
Purchased several as gifts. They arrived on time and were in good condition as the Seller had described. Please note that none of these gift iphones were put on the carrier named. They went on the month to month plans offered at a major chain store that sold a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later they are all working fine. And the low budget carrier service is even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier.I plan to purchase more of these as gifts soon.,1
We ordered this used phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a used phone again! It is a scam!,0
"My htc came in a brand new package with the factory seal, charger, usb, phone, and manual book. The phone is brand new and I've been using it for over 3 weeks with no problems. The hardware and software are great and it has never frozen on me yet. I'm planning on buying another one soon. The price is no complain and I have tmobile data text and internet everything is all functions.",0
The phone arrived defective with a damaged power button and battery back.,0
"Although the telephone was advertised as new, it was actually sold in 2013. So the description wasn't quite accurate.",0
"The phone didn't turn on at all. It was defective, and I had to pay to ship it back and pay a restocking fee. Terrible.",0
I've had iPhone 4s before and I think they're one of the best models Apple has made. This phone was in great shape and looked really sleek. The seller accurately described the phone and I'm very happy with my purchase.,0
"The speakers on this phone are way too loud, and it gets heated up very fast. It's a good phone overall, though; it's very fast.",0
The product arrived as advertised and I had no problems upgrading it. It works great and looks good.,0
"I ordered this iPhone 4 from 'transformersandgmsphones' and it arrived quickly! I've been very happy with it so far :) However, I have one complaint.. it's an Asian version, so every time I take pictures it makes a sound, even if it's in silent mode. If anyone knows how to fix this (without jailbreaking it), please let me know :) Other than that, the iPhone 4 is a great phone. Even though the camera isn't great",0
This phone is a much better phone than the Nokia 920. I have had several different Nokia phones and this one is the best so far.,0
"Sometimes the phone will turn off randomly when I am trying to do something, such as record a video. Other than that, I haven't had any problems :)",0
I bought this phone for my daughter and she is loving it. It was delivered quickly and the condition of the phone was just as was stated. She was able to turn it on and use it right away with absolutely no problems. I would highly recommend purchasing from this seller. He was honest about the product and even added a personal thanks in our receipt and was available to us if there was a problem.,0
I am very disappointed with this phone. It worked fine for about a week then it stopped receiving calls. I returned it to Amazon and received a second phone. This phone lasted for about 3 weeks before it not only stopped receiving calls I frequently had trouble placing calls. Now I am stuck with a phone that is totally useless but Amazon will not let me return because it is a couple of days over the 30 day time limit.,0
"This is the second phone I've owned, and I bought another one only because I moved to another country and my original phone provider wouldn't give me an unlock code.",0
"HTC One rocks. I definitelly recomend to buy it. Great battery life. It works everywhere, not only in the US.",1
"I just got this phone for my wife as a replacement, and we were both amazed at the camera and video quality. We're on the Metro PCS network, and her SIM card from her old phone worked perfectly with no problems.",0
This iPhone has exceeded my expectations. It is so reliable and I have already recommended it to my friends. The voice and other added features are just incredible,1
"0 complaints the iPhone came to me brand new .... and I'm using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!! I think, these models come from Europe, because the battery charger, but these people includes an adapter plug !!!",0
"Very Amazing Phone. I can't believe the phone was 32GB and Factory Unlicked and I paid less than a Brand New locked 8Gb phone. This is a much better deal and I returned the new iPhone I ordered previously, Thank You Very Much For This Amazing Deal I Love Amazon And Bayshine Inc.!!! :D heck ya!",1
"I had to get this phone twice. First, the battery was sent back. Then the phone wasn't unlocked. Don't waste your money on this.",0
"Unit looked clean and appears to work just fine. Its the battery I have an issue with. When unit arrived last Tuesday, the battery was rated as Average by the apps called Battery Life which I installed when i booted the unit. Today the battery is already in a Bad state as indicated by the apps. When u refurbish a unit, the battery must be fresh and brand new.",1
No scratches looks completely new! No problems with it at all it's been working perfectly fine!,1

"Do not buy, This phone does not work, do not turn on or turns on and the charger does not work. another disappointment",1
This phone is great. Awesome audio and display. Gorgeous metal body. Good battery life. It can last a whole day of moderate use on one charge. The only thing I didn't like was the homescreen. The panels displaying my facebook newsfeed are a bit unnecessary.,0
"The delivery was very good as well, the phone arrived very early. The phone was great, everything is perfect, the work very well. I'm happy. I love this phone.Me encanta el celular",1
"This phone arrived as described, unlocked and worked well with Mexican networks TELCEL and Iusacell. I'm giving it 4 stars because it arrived delayed.",0

i needed a phone a fone and i got what i wanti recommend it to anyone who want to buy a good product,1
"This phone is excellent and can compete with the best phones in its range. For me, it is the best phone. It really works like a charm. The camera is good, the screen is good, and it is fast. The only bad thing is the battery life.",0
"The item was used, but it was in excellent condition. It was factory unlocked, as promised. We just had to insert a micro SIM card and we were up and running with our T-Mobile account. The charger that was included didn't work, but we had an extra charger so it wasn't a problem.",0
"best purchase I have ever made. the phone came in great condition, maybe a couple of little scratches but that was mentioned in the details box. I love my iphone and have never had a problem with it",1
"I dropped my phone and the front glass broke, but I continue to use it.",0
Everything is good..... I use it too Finley....next time I'll again purchase if the price low whatever I want.... Thank you very much,1
"""I've had the MOST FRUSTRATING experience with this seller in my life. I wouldn't actually leave any stars for them, just had to. This was iPhone 4s box, the bottom of the which was roughly sealed with some dirty paper to cover the real specks, it was blocked and 16 GB instead of 32 GB. Moreover, the seller wouldn't confirm the return of this product despite my 2 emails to them. I do not recommend anyone to do business with this seller ever!!!""",1
"I had a battery failure after only using the product for an hour. I now have to spend more money to replace the battery, and I would like to be compensated for this expense.",0
"I started using the phone and its okay. However, the lock button does not work. It came in a zip lock bag with a non working apple cable. Nevertheless, I like it. No other problem about it.",0
I'm very happy with my new iPhone 4s! I had been wanting one for a while and finally had the money to buy it. It works perfectly and you can add a carrier to it just like any other iPhone.,0
"I love HTC phones. They're a good brand and their features are great. Their operating system is fast. So far, I have no problems.",0
Could have been better charger cord had a short in it FaceTime needs wifi and no finger print scanner and it should have been 4g,1
I love how my colleagues can text me about any changes or additions to our work schedule.,0
"My M7 was scheduled to arrive between July 18- August 3, but it arrived on July 3rd. At first it didn't work as expected, then I downloaded the system upgrade. Now it works perfectly.",1
"This I phone since arrived never work , the battery do not charge . I don't know whatI have to do.I tried but the I phone turn off all the time .Tks",1
When I'm trying to start the mobile it's not coming up. Mobile is getting switched off,1
"They advertised it as a new phone but it stopped working after 40 days. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but refurbished with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that they mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone.",0
"I was using an iPhone 6, but it was destroyed by water. This looked like a good option until the new iPhone 7's are released. Unfortunately, the performance difference is significant between this phone and an iPhone 6. The battery is really terrible and normally requires charging before the day is over. The phone is super slow - The camera is slow to open; apps are terrible. Not sure if it is the IOS 9 on a iPhone 4 or the phone is bad, but this thing",0
very good product recommend Es excelente producto muy bueno,1
It was a great purchase everything works perfect .. Thanks,1
"I was a little surprised when I got this to find out that it only takes the ""big"" SIM cards, and not the micro or nano. This was kind of a let down, as not too many phones still use these large SIM cards, and therefore would need to switch SIM cards if you already had active service with a GSM carrier.",0
Phone is ok .. but there is a big scratch on camera lense that was not reported,1
"I am slightly disappointed because I ordered for the international version but I got the AT&T unlocked. The features are very good: the cameras are good,32gb internal memory and 2gb Ram.",1
"Excellent conditions and it works great. Yes, it met my expectations. I am happy!",1
"I bought this phone for my mom and I have to say I was tempted to keep it for myself. Feels so great in your hands! The finish of the phone is fantastic, the software works smoothly and quickly and the camera is great! I would recommend this to anyone based on the limited usage so far.",0
"Hi, I'm very upset about the purchase I made on Amazon. The product I received looked used, not new. I sent them back unopened and without the original packaging or instructions. I assume they were second-hand items. They are white, and one of them has a yellowish tinge. I now have doubts about buying appliances online on Amazon. Maybe E-bay is a little more professional about choosing appliance suppliers. Know them inside your network. Regards.",0
I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you.,1
"I wouldn't have minded buying a phone with a defective charger, but I would have liked to know what I was purchasing upfront. Luckily, the charger of the phone I'm switching fits this phone - if not, I'd be a very unhappy man with a new phone and no charger. I do want to say everything else was perfect, and I appreciate the price.",0
"Nice phone, delivered with apple charger and cord. Using it right now.",1
"This phone has stopped reading the Sims card within 4 months, so it is basically useless. It is also out of warranty with Nokia, so I am guessing they just sell it on Amazon once the manufacturer's warranty expires.",0
It was good product but the accessories are not of good quality.the charger is not of good qualityphone has some issue like sound,1
Excellent. It's a great cellphone. Only the battery is not too good...,1
The product arrived on time and is exactly what I wanted. I'm happy with my purchase.,0

"Bought for my great grandsons birthday, excellent condition. Also include a case.",1
"I was really happy with this phone when I first bought it, but then it stopped charging. I tried to take the back off so I could fix the problem, but it seemed like the back was glued on. So I took it to a radio shack and they told me the phone was defective and I would have to buy a new one.",0
"It would be great if there were different ear bud options available, since not one size fits all.",0
"I'm disappointed with this purchase. The clips that hold the SIM card broke as soon as I attempted to put it in the phone, and I had to tape them in just to get the phone to work.",0
"It WAS great for the first three months when I first bought it. üò† Then the phone decided to not charge AT ALL. I tried to get the back of but no matter what I did, the back was a most like it was glued to the phone. So I took it to a radio shack and there was a shortage in the phone it's self and with the back not able to come off the only option was to buy a completely brand new phone. üò†üò†üò†üò†",1
"Love this phone, it's my third one not for the products fault all user errors on my end. Easy to fit in my clutch for nights out, big enough to not slip when I'm texting, glass doesn't crack, can get hot 106 degress from multiple apps use. Loads of storage space- apprei the design feature of the HTC. I did use the remote feature initially and it was simple to set up, now I just find it's as easy to get the real remote. It was novel not necessary. The photo features are enjoyable with the easy of split screen and photo booth functions.",1
The phone has not the original android was root with a kit kat and that caused that the didn't work properly,1
"I really like this phone! It's comparable to other Android phones but much more affordable. I actually prefer it to other LG and Samsung phones I've used in the past. The battery lasts for almost 3 days without needing a charge, and it takes great pictures with the flash.",0
"These speakers are great, but my phone started overheating and freezing within a few weeks of purchase.",0
"I would give this product a strong 2 rating. I got it primarily for the camera, which works very well. However, Windows is a far inferior operating system to Android, which is a real shame because the rest of the product is good.",0
Great seller! I love my Nokia phone. Thank you so much!,0
"I was a little disappointed to see a small scratch on the screen of my new phone when I opened the box, especially since it was a refurbished model. However, it's not a big deal and the phone seems to be working great otherwise. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase.",0
"I received yesterday, when I installed the simm (wich is working on other unlocked iphone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the simm is invalid. I need as urgent to solve this problem. Please help me !!!!!",1
"I purchased this iPhone 4S white, certified refurbished from BuySPRY and Fulfilled by Amazon, and a week after I started to use it, the screen became wrong, stripped and then turn black. I am in Argentina, so I am not sure what to do, because it does not work, but I have no where to claim for a change. I would appreciate an answer for this. Thank you.",0
Phone arrive with marks of useOften phone just switch off.,1
Not unlocked. It is still a Verizon phone. Once I got it up and running I loved it the moment it started working. had to spend extra money to have it switched over to straight talk.. company shipping is terrible it took 35 days to get it to me.,0
I took the phone to the Verizon Store in Lexington SC. They told me they could not activate the phone because it is not one of theirs. What do you suggest I do with this phone?,0
"After a month of use, the phone starts to malfunction and I have not downloaded anything to it yet. By this time, the return date has already expired.",1
Thank you for your positive review! We're glad to hear that your item was delivered on time and that you were happy with the quality of the product.,0
"I bought a BLU Energy X smartphone in December 2015. It was an excellent phone, but the touch screen stopped working after only a short time. I can't find the parts I need to fix it in my country. Can you help me? This is a very important issue for me.",0
Not so good. Phone often froze on me and yea didn't get my charger adapter cord in there but not the adapter.. and have no idea how to return it if is even possible,1
This is an exact replica of the original phone. China did a great job! I'm sending it back right away.,0
When we finally got this phone is was in great condition. Looked brand new!I bought it for my daughter and she was so happy! Everything works well no problems;-),1
"Dear Ben,Thank you for the great experience with buying the Nokia Lumia 1020. The phone is just as described and the photos are amazing. The condition was great too. I will definitely recommend friends to do business with you. Thank you!",0
Thank you so much for the iPhone! It arrived in good condition and I absolutely enjoy getting to know my first ever iPhone device :),0
"Had the original iPhone 1 and finally wore it out. Love the iPhone 4. Does everything I need, texting, talking, web search, maps, etc.When I got it, the text was all in Chinese! Then when I went to the keypad, I tried pressing the small ""world globe"" on the bottom left on the keypad...went straight to English! How simple---in case it happens to you. Love the phone, so I bought another one for my husband.",1
My husband's Motorola Droid broke so I tried to go cheap and replace it with the iPhone 4. Big Mistake!I love iPhones and have always had one. My husband has always used a Droid so this was my attempt to convert him. I had forgotten how limited the iPhone 4 is since it had been a long time since I had that model.I had to go back online and buy him a refurbished Motorola Droid so that he could use the new technology again.,1
"I'm extremely disappointed in my purchase from Amazon. The phone stopped working after less than 30 days, and it's impossible to ship items from other countries into Argentina. I guess it was a waste of time and money. I don't have any plans to shop here again.",0
Not the newest phone but we put it in a case for our toddler and load it with kid games so its perfect (not SIM). Note didn't come in the original packing and had a non-OEM charger but all worked as promised.,1
This is One of the finest phones i ever had.Nice applications and very good settings. Only the problem is skype.,1
iphone I purchased is broken ( the center round button) and locked. I read my order was for a factory unlocked phone and I don't understand.,0
This phone is excellent and I'm glad I didn't waste money on an iPhone. It does everything you need.,0
"Although advertised as NEW this product seems to be refurbished, since the package is not like the one I bought at a HTC store in Europe and the instructions manual is poorly printed.",0
"Would not recommend this phone. The battery life is really poor, only lasting around 5 hours with moderate use. Have to charge it twice a day which is really inconvenient. The picture quality is good but there are other phones with just as good cameras nowadays.",0
"its all right , the only problem with it is just like all iPhones is : the home button will partially stop working.",1
Awesome phone! Comparable to other Android phones but way more affordable. I even like it better than previous LG and Samsung phones I've had. The battery lasts almost 3 days without charging it. It takes great pics and has a flash.,1
phone defective damaged power button and battery back,1
The phone was delivered on time and I was happy with it.,0
"Bought this as a replacement to my broken 8GB iPhone. If you already own an iPhone then you know how useful and widely owned these are. if you don't have one, Apple products, while seemingly fragile, do work extremely well for a long time in terms of performance and durability. I never knew someone who had a physically defective apple anything after any given amount of time. These things do not fall apart ever.",1
"I have had iPhones since the 3G and always liked it. The last time I got a new phone I went with a GalaxyS3 and it was difficult to use, and was always using data plan that nobody could explain why I was going over. So I went online and bought this phone. I have been extremely pleased right from the beginning. The process was easy and it was here well within the time that was stated. I would definitely order from this person again.",1
"As news states, this phone is known for its 41MP camera and grip. It takes pictures beautifully. The phone is comfortable in your hands and fits very nicely-it feels extremely sturdy.I would say the loud colour promotes a persons character. Only gripe is that it is not LTE capable. But why worry about that when there is a 41MP camera? ^_~As promised, the phone is unlocked and navigating the settings to work with my local network had no difficulties. ~TWO THUMBS UP~",1
"Appearance very good. This product initially worked OK but soon started dying suddenly, would not stay charged. Battery probably was not good and needs to be replaced. I was mostly disappointed because I bought this for my son & should've tried to return it as soon as it started giving him trouble.",1
I adore the phone..only wish I had realized I have no way to increase memory.Bit other then that I'm very pleased with the phone and content with my experience with Amazon.,0
This product arrived in box and with accessories that work! But we paid too much for this phone bc it continuously goes to the reboot screen! We are trying to find out how to fix this problem...but it is difficult!,1
I bought this product a month ago and it stopped working. It was a waste of time.,0
This phone is not compatible with T-Mobile service and you will have to restart it frequently to get service.,0
I really like the phone it is very easy to use and can be cusstomized to anyone with tons of aps avilable.,1
This product is in great condition! It arrived without any scratches and looks brand new. It's been working perfectly fine and I haven't had any issues with it.,0
"Great phone, with a nice large screen with good colors and a fast quadcore cpu and a decent gpu.Camera is really good for a 100 dlls device.The only bad thing is that it only has so little ram and the front facing camera is anything but good.",1
Excellent for those who want camera and mobile phone at the same thing.The result of camera shoot excellent perfectly .,1
"This iPhone was very affordable and so far it's worked pretty well. I've had a few issues with it though. Issues, like it freezing for about 15 mn shutting down and restarting. Or a slow processor. The phone still works to this day and I've had this issue twice. It's been two weeks since it's happened though! Overall it's been a great phone so far and I am very pleased I got it. Good luck:)",1
"I received my iPhone promptly and in good condition. It looks and feels brand new, and I have not had any issues with it thus far.",0
"I'm very disappointed with this product because the touch screen stopped working a few months after I bought it. There are no calibration settings to fix it, and no means of fixing it on your own.",0
"I love it, is the best phone I've ever seen. Great to hold, the sound is amazing and Android works perfectly. Do not even doubt, this is the best phone on the market.",1
When I received this phone I was very impressed by how well the outside of the phone looked. It looked new. Unfortunately when I turned it on there were a few very faint but noticible yellow lines going down the screen. I returned it because I was nervous that this could become a major issue in the future.,1
"Great phone! It looks and feels great, and the display is really good. The radio is also good, but the camera isn't as good as I'd hoped. It works fine with AT&T, but I wasn't able to get the analog TV to work - everything is digital now, I guess.",0
"I'm not happy with this phone. It randomly deletes my photos, which is really frustrating. Browsing the web is slow and inconvenient, and I can't open or read a lot of my emails. The camera is good, but it takes a long time to take and load photos, which is frustrating. And if you enjoy using Facebook, this phone is absolute crap. I'm very disappointed.",0
"the phone stop working after five months of use, the tactile function of the phone doesn't work",1
Fair over all..product work good no problem thank you I would grade you a plus. Of course I would recomended..,1
"To me, Windows phone is the most wonderful phone in the world. And this phone, Lumia 1020, with 41MP camera, is, like the title headline I gave, a marvelous phone with perfect camera. Awesome.",1
"I got my first one refurbished, they sent me the wrong color, and it was locked. But after I returned it and got the right one, it was beautiful! I love it. It's quick, smooth, and different. I would buy it again. I'm never disappointed by Nokia or Microsoft.",0
Purchased the phone in February and it died today April 14. Exactly a month from its return window. Save your money!,1
"This is a very nice basic unlocked phone with 2 sim slots (regular large sim cards). It's mainly for making calls, good sound, doesn't drop calls. Strangely it does not have many ringtones. You can text and browse, too---but the speed is slow. Perfect backup",1
"buy two phones refurbished and have received USED micas screen with marks and scratches from use of protective liners or cases , the metal bezel with many brands use too. that just hurts the just received in Venezuela if not immediately returned .",1
"I'm disappointed because I was told this phone was unlocked, but it turns out I need to spend more money to get it unlocked for use in Nigeria. Please keep your promises when selling a product.",0
I bought a 'new' iPhone and found that it was working perfectly and had all the right accessories in the box. Great price for a great phone!,0
This phone is described as new but it is clearly not. The first phone died after 2 hours and the screen went blank. The second one worked okay but the microphone was bad.,0
"The iPhone is perfect, but the battery doesn't last long. Only 12 hours on standby. I had to return it and buy a 5c instead.",0
It was good product but the accessories are not of good quality.The charger and headphones are not of good quality.Proven the charger and headphones are fake.,1
"This phone is great for use in China. I have some black lines on my screen when the display is black, but it doesn't affect normal use. The camera on this phone is awesome.",0
"So far, so good. It works well for the price and holds a charge for many days.",0
"I cannot use hotspot on my phone because it used to be an AT&T phone and I believe there is a problem with the bootloader. The phone works well, but the screen has some dead cells. I was told it was only cosmetic, but there is also chipping on two angles. The metal is also gravelled. I don't think this was a good buy for me.",0
It is not proffesionale refurbixhed utem. Any people not check this phone after repair. I receive phone in bad conditions.,1
ÓøøI'm very happy with the phone. It works perfect and the battery lasts good. I would recommend buying this phone!ÓøæChatGPT: ÓøøI'm very happy with the phone. It works perfect and the battery lasts good. I would recommend buying this phone!Óøæ,0
Everything is great..... I use it too frequently....next time I'll buy it again if the price is low for whatever I want.... Thank you very much,0
"I ordered the Nokia Lumia 1020 unlocked phone few days ago. But, to my surprise, after 3 days my phone is dead.I put it in charger but of no use. I was very disappointed since I bought this phone knowing of its good camera and other specifications. Since its micro SD is not external I lost all the pictures I took. Really frustrated I am returning the phone.",1
30 minute battery life isn't nearly enough.,1
"If everything you ship is like this, I will tell everyone not to buy from you. I got this phone and it started breaking after a day. On the third day, one of the speakers went out, then the lock button stopped working. Now the home button barely works. I'm sure the rest of the phone will fail eventually. Thanks for wasting my money.",0
"I buy a smartphone BLU Energy X, last December 2015. It is an excellent phone, but unfortunately with so little time to use, the touch screen does not work, and here in my country is not accessible to find the parts. You can help me, it is very important to me solve this problem.",1
Best Camera ever.....o(^-^)o Will there be a camera higher then 41MP? For now get this one you will love it....^_^,1
"WOW!!. I just love this phone!! Go ahead and buy it, the price at which it is sold by this seller is a steal!! Match it with Amazon excellent customer service, i am a truly satisfied customer!!",1
Two years later and it's still working like a charm. Perfect condition. Amazing!,0
"That's good. Big to you thanks! I very much liked to be your client, I will surely use your services again.",1
Good phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk in the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you.,1
I received the IPhone 4 and found that the microphone does not work; I spent a lot of money for a paperweight. I want my money back.,1
Seller was very helpful.Product is working very well.a couple of scratches. One is due to the hard cover which was covering the top of the screen,1
"The sensitivity of the touchscreen was sometimes too high on some parts of the screen, and non-existent on other parts. Rebooting the phone usually fixed the issue. Overall, it's not a bad phone for the price.",0
"It's a pretty nice phone, only problem is it runs hot if you use it for too long. That's my only problem.",0
i got the phone as a bday gift. Its bin nothing but a hassle. All i wanted was an iphone 4s for prpaid verizon. I had to buy sim card and adapter additionally and make phone calls - all to find out that it is not going to work. Is not anything i wanted. Its an at&t phone and will never work w verizon service. ThAnks for ruining the birthday gift - and causing so much of a hassle i didnt need nor hav the time for- extremly upset and disappointed.,1
"Unfortunately my experience was not entirely positive with the product. It arrived still wrapped in its box and looked beautiful. After I went to the AT& T store got its SIM card and was already to go, I found out that the home button only works occasionally. It is unfortunate for such a high priced item. I still love the Apple products but I am wondering whether buying direct from Apple or AT&T is cheaper and less hassle in the long run",1
Positive items: the wide array of apps.; the speed; the sound; the cameraNegative: the short live of the battery,1
"I ordered a factory unlocked phone, but I received a locked one instead. I won't trust this provider again.",0
"The introduction of mobile advertising is unlocked, but they gave me a not unlock! Moreover, this mobile phone when not in use and when to use are very hot, hot, feeling ready to explode same. In addition, the battery is not durable, in a few hours after a full charge, there is no electricity (nothing to do, just standby). So I asked to return, after obtaining the consent of the August 18 return by mail, they receive 20 August. However, it has been passed eight days, they have not given me a refund, did not receive any explanation.",1
"I recently had to replace my lost iPhone 4s, so I turned to Amazon. I was very impressed with the quality of the product - it was like new, and much less expensive than what I've been seeing on eBay. I may buy another one just to sell it on eBay for the profit!",0
"This cell phone is great! Everything works perfectly, and its design is beautiful.",0
"The phone overall is decent. A lot of people that reviewed the phone claim they can get several hours off of one charge. I on the other hand (I've had it a little less than a year now) can only get about 5 hours with moderate use. I usually end up charging the phone twice a day. And this has been the case ever since I got it. Picture quality is definitely great but nowadays the cameras that are coming out, you can get about the same quality. Bottom line, dont get this phone. What's the point of having an amazing camera when its battery will be low all the time?",1
"This was a gift for my wife and she is happy with it. Everything works fine except for the Wi-Fi, which is grayed out and not usable. Just search ""Wi-Fi issues on iPhone 4s"" and you'll see what I mean. You can make your own decision on this.",0
"I bought this phone a month ago.... i have not drop it neither drop liquid on it AND THE TOUCHSCREEN IS NOT WORKING!!!!!!!!!! I am really frustrated, this is a $600 phone!!!! do this mean i just gave away that amount of money?",1
"This product is a great deal! It can be used as an iPod and a backup phone, and it does everything an iPod can do and more.",0
"I bought this iPhone 4s for a very good price of $204. It was locked, but that was okay because I paid $30 to unlock it and it worked great. The condition is very good with no problems. However, it did not come with any apps or programs, so I had to download everything. Even so, it's still a good deal for the price. I've been using it for over a month now with no problems, and I'm very happy with it",0
"I bought a used HTC M7 from PONADS in Stealth Black for $209, and I am impressed with the condition of the phone. It only has 4-5 noticeable scratches, and it works perfectly.I can only speak for PONADS, who delivered the item quickly and in great condition. I would give them 5/5 stars.The phone itself is amazing as well. I love it and would give it 5/5 stars.I",0
"I tried to activate this phone with Verizon, but they said it could not be activated on their network. Based on this, I have to conclude that it is not an unlocked phone, notwithstanding the product description.",0
The phone is excellent and works on either AT&T or T-Mobile out of th box. I have it on T-Mobile currently. The Windows Phone platform is the best that I have used that integrates work and play.,0
"This is my first Windows phone, upgrading from Nokia N8. I'm still getting used to it, but I like the clear and detailed pictures, the large screen, and the ease of use. The battery isn't as great, and it's hard to hear the phone ring, but overall it's been good so far. It works well on T-Mobile's LTE network.",0
"I used to have an iPhone 4s, but I was worried about switching to the Nokia Lumia. I've been using it for about two weeks now, and I'm really happy with it. It's fast and furious (lol), and the camera is incredible. The only downside is that it gets quite warm sometimes, especially when I've been using the camera or listening to music for awhile. I guess the iPhone doesn't get as warm, but it's not better than the Nokia Lumia",0
I like the cellphone is very easy to drive the photo are 10/10 for me is better than android i has Samsung s4,1
"I never received the phone from this seller- it was a scam. Amazon made good on it though. Even if I had received it, it wouldn't have worked in the US because AT&T deliberately removes key features and limits memory on these phones. If you can wait 6 months, you can get an unlocked version that works on other telecoms in the US. It's sad that US citizens have to suffer from technology-oppressing, ultra-greedy companies like AT&T",0
The combination of Nokia and Windows Phone is a symphony. The only possible oponent could perhaps be iPhone 6.,1
"If everything you ship is like this than i will advise everybody to not buy from you. I got this phone and about a day after it started to break. The third day one of the speakers went out, the next the lock button got stuck and no longer works. now the home button barely works, i have to push certain areas for it to even respond. Im pretty sure the rest of this phone is going to fail at some point, thanks for wasting my money",1
"I was using an iPhone 6, but it was lost to the water. This looked like a good option until the new iPhone 7's are released. Unfortunately, the performance difference is significant between this phone and an iPhone 6. The battery is really weak and normally requires charging before the day is over. The phone is super slow - The camera is slow to open; apps are terrible. Not sure if it is the IOS 9 on a iPhone 4 or the phone is bad, but this thing is much slower than the iPhone 4 I had years ago. Overall, the phone is very frustrating to use!",1
"Great quality, workes perfectly and looks new.",1
I ordered an iPhone 4 and found that the microphone doesn't work. I'm extremely disappointed because I spent a lot of money on this phone and it's basically useless to me. I would like a refund.,0
"This phone would freeze up on me and was terribly slow. The reception was a very bad, too. This phone was running on 3g. I went back to my android phone.",1
" Apple no longer supports this product, and it cannot be updated to the latest iOS. Be cautious when purchasing.",0
It's a shame that apple restreindre some of their amazing products so users have to use methods like jailbrake an unlocking that some times limits the usage of the products worldwide.,1
We bought our phone used to avoid the 2 year contract and high prices from the major companies. We put the phone on Straight Talk and we are loving it.,0
This is the best phone I've ever had. Everyone is jealous of the 41 megapixel camera.,0
Do not buy!!! Bought two of these phones and the touch screen went out on both of them. No warranty and the the company will not take it back.,0
"I ordered the Nokia Lumia 1020 unlocked phone a few days ago, but to my surprise, it died after just three days. I put it in the charger but it was no use. I was very disappointed, because I bought this phone because of its good camera and other specifications. Since the micro SD is not external, I lost all the pictures I took. I'm really frustrated, and I'm returning the phone.",0
"Phone is good as expected, missing org box which was not mentioned.and best part its on latest iOS v",1
"I'm very happy with my purchase of this iPhone - it arrived in great condition, with just a few small scratches as noted in the listing. I've been using it for awhile now and have had no problems whatsoever.",0
"The product was defective, worked for a month and the phone is dead",1
"The iPhone came to me brand new, and I'm using it in Caracas, Venezuela, without any trouble. I think these models come from Europe, because the battery charger uses an adaptor plug.",0
It's a good thing when someone who doesn't normally use an Android phone starts using one to stay in touch.,0
Arrived diligently . Phone was as new. I installed micro chip and called,1

"At first look this is an amazing phone but in fact it isn't. I had too many problems with it and the first one and the most important was it special feature, its camera, it has stopped working after a small drop from a table, now I try to open the camera and it doesn't work at all. What a big deal, a 41mpx camera that doesnt work.Also the phone has problems with video streaming, it shows a message of error ""Video could not be decoded"" and the wifi hotspot has several problems and not always I get a good connection to internet from other devices.",1
I love my phone the only thing s I can't get pictures messages with metro pcs ... Maybe with T-Mobile I will try soon,1
"I bought an iPhone from Amazon, and it stopped working after only 5 days. They sent me a replacement, but that one stopped working after only 6 months. The front camera on the 2nd phone stopped working after a couple months. I'm very disappointed.",0

Great communication with seller. Battery wouldn't stay charged but instead of sending back which they offered to exchange. I just switch my battery from my old phone to this one.,0
Product was in good condition but was kind of dirty and the speaker seems to be going out other then that I love it.,1
This phone needs to be reset every once in a while.,0
"The camera quality on this device is poor, but it is otherwise a well-built product for a very low price.",0
"I've only had this phone for a day, but so far it's working great with my T-Mobile service in the US. I was able to get calling, texting, media messaging, and WiFi all up and running as soon as I put my SIM card in. The battery seems to be draining a bit quickly, but that may just be because I've been using it non-stop to set everything up.",0
"THE ELECTION HAS BEEN GOOD, THE SELLER HAS GIVEN GOOD INFORMATION, THE PHONE IS WHAT I EXPECTED, GOOD PRODUCT",1

"I absolutely LOVE this phone, the cameras are stunning. such sharp image, it honestly makes me feel like a photographer. Its definitely worth the price and theres a lot of cool features. the only thing I don't like is that the windows store doesn't have snapchat :( but the phones totally worth it. the only problem I really had was having to set up my family but once you do everything is fine.",1

Great pictures but performance is the same as lower Lumia model's,0

"It's like a new iPhone. The iPhone has no sign weariness, and it's working perfectly. Battery in good shape lasting for a day or two.",1
"Although advertised as NEW this product seems to be refurbished, since the package is not like the one I bought at a HTC store in Europe and the instructions manual is poorly printed.",1
"This cell phone outside is very hurt, a lot of dust, too bad, all the accessories are not original, I want like to return, but I'm in China. I think I will not be here to buy second-hand goods.Feeling too bad! ! !",1
Great cell phone! Everything works perfectly and its design is lovely.,0
"This Amazon review notes the advantages of the product being reviewed, namely that it has a lot of space for holding music, movies, books, contacts, apps, and pictures.",0
Great phone. Arrived before expected. Good pictures.,0
I do not have a good rating to give this product. I'm not sure if the product was used as I am seeing 2 videos and 4 pictures on the phone. Why am I seeing tht??? It seems as if it was taken accidentally during packaging but I can't b certain. Not pleased.,1
"Amazingly, the product works perfectly, I recommend it to everyone.",1
"I was skeptical and did a lot of research before purchasing. I waited until it came off the shelves to get the 50% price reduction (yes, I'm 'frugal'). I contacted this seller with a myriad of questions, all were answered nearly immediately and I took the plunge.I couldn't be happier! One of the best things I bought for myself.",1
I am satisfied with the product and the delivery time. It is a very good deal!,0
Great cell phone! Everything functions perfectly and its design is lovely.,0

It had light showing through the black out areas of the screen and the volume buttons were not fit correctly compaired to the one I already own.,1

"not a great phone this is only phone without any acessoires , lock button not working , send me my paymant",1
Thank you for your positive review of your purchase! We're glad to hear that everything is working perfectly for you.,0
Still a great phone. You can't get a mid tier phone that's new with the same quality for the price.The only problem was that The Wireless Circle sold me a used phone that was supposed to be new. It was obvious because there was a screen protector installed by a previous owner. I returned it and purchased a One through WCE and it was actually new. Inspect it closely because you don't want a 2 year old phone that's possibly been used.,1
Love it now that my work mates can text me for any shift changes or new shift been added into work schedule,1
I purchased this book for a friend and he loves it.,0
"The phone was brand new and worked great. I got it in two business days, which was awesome. I paid for standard shipping. My only complaint is that the price was a little ridiculous for an iPhone 4, so I'm rating the phone a 4.",0
"I bought this phone in hopes that it would be super great. However, it's not bad. It's actually in really good condition, since I bought it used. But the battery life on this is extremely crappy. If I charge it overnight to 100%, it will be down to 85% within 20 minutes of usage. Also, charging this phone is a hassle, since it takes forever to charge.",0
"I've only been using this phone for half a year, and it's already having problems with system halts and blank screen. I also can't seem to get data roaming to work, even though I've checked the settings several times. The wifi does work, though. I'm giving it three stars because it's been good when all the functions are working properly.",0
One of the best phones I've ever owned love windows than you will love this phone everything is so easy to use its very wellbuilt and the voice recognition is best I've ever used,1
phone needs to be hard reset every now and again,1
"I am very happy with the product I purchased on Amazon. The price was great, the delivery was very fast, and the quality of the phone is excellent. Thank you, Amazon!",0
Please send a very bad version. What is going on? What are you asking me again? Too bad the broken screens which use the blue lights. I asked for my money.,1
The phone is very basic as you would expect but the built in TV tuner is useless. It's a Analog TV. You'll be lucky if you could even find one watchable channels.,1
I love the product that was purchased thru amazon. I love the prices the fast delivery and the quality of the phone that I have now. Thank you amazon!! A+,1
"it is as the description, except it doesn't support Arabic language, which i did not ask about before buying it",1

"This phone is gorgeous, and has the best camera available on a smartphone. I've been using Windows Phone for over three years and would not switch to any other operating system willingly.",0
"Appearance very good. This product initially worked OK but soon started dying suddenly, would not stay charged. Battery probably was not good and needs to be replaced. I was mostly disappointed because I bought this for my son & should've tried to return it as soon as it started giving him trouble.",1
It's OK. THe surface is very new. The speed and the baterry is Ok. I could not get its charge,1
Loses one star for because it never has full reception no matter where I go. I know friends that have the same phone and they get great reception almost every where. The camera is amazing! The screen is crisp and I can see it clearly even in the sunlight. Still lovin my new phone.,1
Great phone is there any warranty service let me know ty,1
Instruction book would be nice to see what this phone has to offer and how to use I am 73 yrs old and It would be nice to know what my phonehas to offer to where I can rate this a 5 star. I could have gone with the JITTERBUG instead without bells and whistles for a lot less. I know thephone that was sent does a lot of good things but since I don't have a book to tell me what this phone can do I'm right back to the Jitterbug.It's just OK,1

This phone never turns on and is very bad. I need my money back.,0
"Battery lasts forever. Very fast, no lagging, and no issues. I've gotten nothing but performance and perfection from it so far and I've had it for a few weeks now. Best choice I could have made though, definitely happy with my decision.",1
"The phone's quality was better than expected. I was skeptical at first if it would be actually unlocked, but so far it's been good.",0
"This phone is almost brand new. It has a really small bump, but it's easy to miss. It's a great phone, and it comes with all the cables you need. It was delivered on time, and I'm really happy with it. Thanks!",0
I was happy with this purchase because the seller described the item accurately and I am completely satisfied with it.,0
"I have been using this cell phone for one month, and it has worked very well. I would definitely recommend it to others. Just be aware that this type of Apple cell phone is not compatible with Sprint, Verizon, or METROPCS service, but it works fine with T-Mobile and AT&T.",0
	My brother found out that the charger and speaker didn't work after I sent the phone to him in Vietnam.,0

I've been really happy with this phone. The beats audio is incredible and it's lived up to all my expectations.,0
"This iPhone was everything that it was advertised to be. I had a bad experience with used and restored iPhones in the past, so I decided to go for a new one, and it was worth it.",0

"Hi, I bought this phone used and all together with shipping it came out to be $133.00. This is the used black iPhone4 16gb! Shipping was fast! To say this phone is used, it's in excellent condition. I mean, I really almost can't tell that it was used. Seriously! I have service on it with AT&T and everything seems to work fine! The only little niggle is that you have to push the home button firmly in order",0
"The phone looks nice, but it doesn't hold a charge well. You need to charge it at least 3 times a day, even if you're not using it.",0
"I am very upset about this phone! I bought it and there was a no refund policy attached. I figured that because it had Gorilla Glass, and I had heard great things about it, that it would be fine. But within a month I had a scratch and crack on the screen. Nokia will not replace or fix it and the seller has a no refund policy. So I literally threw away $300+. I am not a happy camper right now!",0
Love this Phone. I never get tired of if. Even afther 1+ year of using it.,1
"The phone was covered in bumps and scratches when it arrived, and the headphones that came with it were broken. I would not recommend this product.",0

"I was disappointed because the pictures showed that I would be getting 2 cases and a charger, but I only received one case.",0
This phone is awesome. Great audio and display. Beautiful metal body. The battery life is good. It can last a whole day of moderate use on one charging. The only thing I didn't like was the homescreen. The panels displaying my facebook newsfeed are a bit superfluous.,1
"We bought this phone and it worked for a few days, but then the battery starting dying quickly and the WiFi stopped working. We're requesting a warranty replacement, but we wouldn't buy another ""factory refurbished"" phone from this seller.",0
The mic of the earphone is not work. Just got it two days and the price is cheaper now. I like iPhone 4. Beautiful. Bit my SIM card is big one. How can I make it smaller,1

"
The charging port on this device did not work at all.",0
"It's been a month since I bought this product for my mom. So far it's been good. I mean, it is an iPhone 4S, you can't really set your expectations too high.

"No es confiable este proveedor de celulares, debido a que me fue enviado un celular Iphone como nuevo y fue vendido en el ano 2010 a otra persona, o sea era basura. Fui directamente a una tienda apple en Florida porque nunca sirvio y resulto ser que estaba fuera de garantia. Gracias a apple tengo un iphone",1

"i bought i phone 4 and this i phone supposed to be used like new but i surprised when i found the back camera is scratched and not working , really it was very bad",1
My mom liked it. The only thing is that the phone is locked. It costs about a hundred dollars to have my mom unlock it in China.,0
"SInce this iphone 4 ,I have bougt 4,4s,5.But I think this generation is the most classic phone .Just as Jobs said ,it redesign cellphone",1
The phone is very powerful and has an amazing display. The speed is super and the camera is decent. I would give it 5 stars overall. I love the phone.,0
"There seems to be an issue with the battery- it only lasts for an hour after being charged. Additionally, the microphone doesn't seem to work properly. This is especially disappointing because I ordered it as a gift.",0
I had a terrible experience with this company. The guy who I spoke to scammed me and I could barely hear the person I was talking to.,0
Very happy with it. It came just like it said like new. It was a sweet 16 present for my daughter and has survived so far. Thanks,1

"The Screen star fell apart with no reason, it is cracking and seems like still cracking more and more.",1
"This phone arrived sooner than I thought it would. It's unlocked and a great deal for the price. The battery is terrible, though. It will read as 14% charged and then die a minute later. Other than that, it's been great.",0
As of today I still DO NOT have it working with StraightTalk. NOT happy. 3 times!!! We have had to get a different SIM card and still no luck.,1
"No where does it state DO NOT REMOVE BATTERY. When I opened it my battery just fell out, turns out if it is removed it wont even turn on. Piece of crap.",1
"I bought this phone for my high school son, he uses it for just 4 days the phone drops on cushioned carpet floor and the screen stops working.",0
I like the phone but when I got it the lock button didn't work and the screen had line all on it. I wasn't pleased.,1
"we are extremely happy with the HTC 1 M7 it does everything it says it does, I am a complete novice to these sort of phones and I find it very easy to use, the camera is producing the best and clearest photos, a friend just bought a new IPhone 5 because she was told it is the phone to buy for the best camera and when she saw the pics on ours she realized she bought the wrong phone, the HTC 1 M7 is top quality",1
This product is excellent for those who want a camera and mobile phone in one device. The result of the camera shoot is excellent and perfect.,0
"This product works well, as it was described. It works great. I have Straight Talk instead of ATT and there is no difference compared to using ATT.",0
"Great phone! It's small and comfortable, perfect for anyone who wants a basic phone.",0
"I bought this phone as a refurbished, unlocked phone. I could use my home WiFi to look things up and start downloading apps before my SIM card from the new company arrived. I bought a 16 GB phone because I have a 32 GB iPod that I use to store my music and other games.",0
"Great phone, looks, style, feel, very good, display great. Radio good, camera not good, works att good, analog tv didn't work, everything is digital now.",1
"I absolutely love this phone! I just didn't expect the yellow casing to have cracks and dents in it and there are chips taken out of the top left corner of the screen. When I'm talking to people on the phone, they say I sound muffled. I have had this phone since last year and now the audio sometimes doesn't work when I record video. I cant use talk to text, voice command or shazam anymore cause the mic quit working ‚òπ but besides all that, I love this phone!! I'm just gonna have to buy a new one instead of a used one.",1
I bought this for a friend and he says that after he used it he loved it. The ultrapixel camera is awesome,1
"The product was a gift for someone, but once they received it and tried to use it, the return window had already expired. We charged the phone for the first time and found that the battery wouldn't hold a charge. Within a few hours of minimal use, the battery was already drained.",0
Really like my phone.looks expensive which it is. I didn't know it was a HTC one7 I didn't pay attention to it when I was ordering it I was just looking at the picture of the phone and got excited and ordered it right away because the price was a little down ..I wanted the HTC one 8.so I'm going to keep the phone for a year and then probably the end of the year I will get the one I really want then they'll have something higher than that and I will change my mind about the HTC one 8..then I will get the one that is higher than that.which I know will be a HTC one 9 or 10....if it's not too much for my pocket...i prayi can afford it anyway.,1
"This phone is really unlocked, I just put in my SIM card and activated it using iTunes.",0
"For refurbished, looks good, charger arn't oem, but does the job!",1
The phone had already some repair done to it. The on and off device was broken and I had to bring it to a repair shop to make it again. It costs me 50$. The repairman discovered it was repaired before. Since I was abroad it was to hard to sent the phone back. Very bad business. I was conned. Severina Kolloffel,1
The iPhone arrived in excellent condition and looks brand new. It has great battery life and appears to have never been used. We activated it on Tracfone using their Bring Your Own Phone (BYOP) SIM card and had no problems.,0

"This phone never turn on,very bad.i need my money.",1
"This phone didn't last 2 months. When I checked to view the return policy, it was only for 30 days. That's not fair. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware!",1

The phone also came a clear silicone case, the charger and USB, user manuals, battery and a great high quality pair of headphones!

"I ordered a black 32gb iPhone 4, but got a white one instead. The phone didn't look used and was factory unlocked as I needed. The phone is very buggy, I'm not sure if it's the software that unlocked it or if that's just the iPhone's quality. Either way, I'm happy knowing I can use any GSM carrier and have plenty of memory to last until upgrade time.",0
I'm using an iPhone 4S while my iPhone 4 gets fixed and I really miss the 4S. This camera is significantly worse than the one on the 4S.,0
"This phone would not hold a charge. The phone's battery was partially melted and immediately had to get a new battery. Apparently ""refurbished"" doesn't include a new battery. Very disappointed.",0
Nice phone. Received as described. Battery is the only downside.,1
"First of all, this wasn't even AT&T. It freezes and glitches a lot, and doesn't even run on IOS 8. I mean, it does its job, but I'm not satisfied.",0
"I'm very particular about my things and I noticed that the phone came with a scratch right through the light for the camera. Even though it doesn't affect the picture quality, I was disappointed that amazon said it was a brand new phone! I expect brand new phones to be in pristine condition!",0
I was very happy with my purchase from this seller. The item was exactly as described and arrived promptly. I will definitely shop with them again in the future.,0
"After about three weeks of use, I noticed the battery running out very quickly. Now, sometimes it goes from 68% to dead instantaneously, and sometimes it will stay on 1% for hours.I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to fail that quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return.",1
"The iPhone is working ok. But when i recieved the item, have not box and charger cable and headphone. Only wall charger :(",1
"That's good. Big to you thanks! I very much liked to be your client, I will surely use your services again.",1
"The phone works great, I'm just not an iPhone person.",1
"iphone 4S is not great. Its slow, and the screen often shakes when I'm trying to use it. It also gets really hot when I talk on it, and the battery drains really quickly if I'm on a call for more than 20 minutes.",0
I got the phone and it didn't work. There was even lint in the plug-in port.,0
"This phone looks like a refurbished phone, and it doesn't work very well.",0
"Phone came in perfect condition, also came unlocked as promised(I'm writing this straight from the iPhone on straight talk) very satisfied.",1
"Updating from my last post when I bought the phone, the screen was messed up. I ordered a new screen and put it in the phone. It began working, then now all of a sudden it keeps freezing and I have to restart the phone to get it working. I'm not pleased at all. It's hard to believe this is a new phone I spent my hard earned money on. I'm ordering from somewhere else.",0
"Great then. Now it's not so much. Otherwise, great phone as of 2016.",0
"This is the best phone on the market! I love it! It's great to hold and the sound is amazing! Android works perfectly on it! Don't even hesitate, this is the best phone you can get!",0
I absolutely love my Windows phone! The camera on the Lumia 1020 is fantastic - it takes perfect pictures every time. Highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a great camera phone.,0
"I have never written a review for a product I have purchased before, but I am making an exception for Mr. Kyle Wunderli of Better Deals FASTER. He is a preeminent businessman with high quality products and superb customer skills. His delivery time is also super fast. Although I paid a little more from this seller than another, I would definitely purchase from him again!",0
"I love this phone. The cameras are great. They produce really sharp images. It makes me feel like a professional photographer. The phone is definitely worth the price. There are a lot of cool features. The only thing I don't like is that the windows store doesn't have snapchat. But the phone is totally worth it. The only problem I had was setting up my family, but once you do that, everything is fine.",0
Bought this phone for my girlfriend and it looks great and all. Great. Battery life and picture but one problem. It won't let her send or receive texts sometimes and calls as well. She has straight talk and it says she has signal but won't make calls or send texts.sometimes when we reboot it it will work but for a bit.I do recommend BLU phones but I think we got a defective one.,1
Look's like a new brand iPhone and works perfectly. Just what i was looking for.,1

Opyou are the first person i bought a iphone from! I love this when i got it it looked like it was brand new! Even though it had scratchs i cant get over it!,1
"Many people may be drawn to this phone based on its amazing camera. However, I would caution against buying it. I had too many problems with it, and the most important one was with the camera. It stopped working after I dropped it from a table. Now, when I try to open the camera, it doesn't work at all. This is a big issue, as the 41mpx camera is a major selling point of this phone. Additionally, the phone has problems with video",0
I purchased this with the honesty of the seller that the phone was unlocked and it was not. It cost me an additional $40.00 to get it unlocked.,0
"I had to send this back because it would not go past the welcome screen. As I was entering language, location, and the beginning of the WiFi router and password, it would cycle back to the welcome screen and start all over again. I first thought it was happening because the phone was not fully charged, so I charged it over night. It continued to persist, so I sent the phone back.As soon as I brought it to a UPS store, I was credited the amount I spent.",1
"Excellent -Very Loud Speaker , Great Display , Great Camera , This was a Gift to my Mother & Father & They LOVE it!",1
The phone I purchased had a problem with the home button. I was able to return it and got all my money back,1

"It's an iPhone 4 that was in very good condition, well packaged, and delivered on time. However, I ordered an unlocked phone, and the one I got was not unlocked. This cost me an extra $100 before I could actually use the phone.",0
Our 1st time to order a cell phone on line. We've always gone into our AT&T store directly. This iphone is like new. No trouble getting personal contact info transfered and having the phone activated. Only wish we had ordered 2 phones from the same seller... Now I on the hunt for another great deal for our 2nd iphone 4s. Wish I could find more from A&Z. Thank You,1

I reorder the phone from them again hopefully they will give me a better phone which wont have any glitch and functions for a long time.",1
The Cell Apple iPhone 4 (Black) 32GB (Factory Unlocked) was very good. Excelent. I give you thanks a lot.,0
I am so upset about this phone!! I bought it and there was a no refund policy attached. I figuired due to the Gorilla Glass and i have heard great things about that it would be fine. Well within a month I had a scratch and crack on the screen. Nokia will not replace or fix it and the seller on here has a no refund policy . So I literally threw away $300 + dollars. I am not a happy camper right now!,1
I gave this to my granddaughter and it's too smart for anyone to figure out. She can run it just fine.,0
Love it.shipped on time . Was exactly as described.i have strait talk and this phone dose work with it. You will need to get a SIM card.,1
"The phone is great except for the battery. It lasts only a few hours, and even that is questionable.",0
Stopped working a month after I bought it ... Waste of time,1
The phone is pretty good. The camera is brilliant. The only thing is that there are not many apps for Windows OS. The rest is awesome!,0
This is the best ever! I broke it and I'm going to buy the same! Recommended!,0
"I wouldn't have minded buying a phone with a dysfunctional charger, but I would have liked to know what I was purchasing upfront. Luckily, the charger of the phone I'm switching fits this phone - if not, I'd be a very unhappy man with a new phone and no charger. I do want to say everything else was perfect, and I appreciate the price.",1

I was disappointed with my purchase from this seller. I ordered a Samsung Galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language.,0
"I was expecting to receive an UNLOCKED cell phone, but it seems that it's not the case. I have been to 2 different phone stores and they couldn't get it to work.",0

"This phone is great for the price! Fantastic battery life, great processing speed, easy to use interface, and it looks good! The only downside is that this model doesn't seem to have any other case options besides the one that comes with it, which is just a simple rubber covering that offers minimal protection.",0
"After 5 full discharges and 5 full charges, I get just over 48 hours of stand-by time on the battery. According to the specifications I found online, the stand-by time should be closer to 200 hours. I'm done with buying refurbished products.",0
"I attempted to use a different SIM card, but the phone did not recognize it. Consequently, I am unable to use the phone for any purpose.",0
My husband is using this phone outside of the US and it works great!,1

"Do not buy this phone. it is used, no head phone, chip charger not original, no iPhone box",1
Its a really good phone but i guess i was always impatient. In conclusion it should not take nearly 2 months to deliver,1
Bought factory refurbished and it's just like a brand new phone! Couldn't be happier with it.,1
"Within a month this phone started having issues. I have had it in a heavy-duty case and never dropped it, but it will only make calls when it can get a signal. It has been awful; the buttons work sometimes and sometimes they don't, and sometimes they work on their own. It rarely has any signal, even when I am logged in to my wifi and standing next to the router - no bars. This is the worst phone I have ever bought. I contacted the",0
"Apple makes an excellent product, so I have no complaints about the phone itself. However, it came with no accessories: not even a charger?!? That was disappointing.",1

I'm so glad we bought this phone! It's in perfect condition and we were able to set it up without even contacting the carrier. This was a great investment/starter phone for our teenage daughter who wanted an iPhone.,0
I believe I bought this used for my son and it was in great working condition.,1
"This phone is great. The audio and display are both excellent, and the metal body is beautiful. The battery life is good - it can last a whole day of moderate use on one charge. The only downside is the homescreen; the panels displaying my Facebook newsfeed are a bit superfluous.",0
Iphone that I bought is broken ( the round button in the middle) and locked. - I read in my order - Factory unlocked - and I don't understand.,1
I bought this for a friend and he says that after he used it he loved it. The ultrapixel camera is awesome,1
"Please note that this is an AT&T branded 877 model that is unlocked, not the true unbranded international version. The title just needs to be updated to reflect this to avoid confusion. Also, it's pretty cool that Amazon sold a new device rather than refurbished.",0
This phone is terrible... it keeps shutting down.,0
"I bought this Iphone form SJohnson236, and they send me locked Iphone with Gevey Adapter and ATT Software, I returned it the same day, and I got the refund, Thanks to Amazon",1
"The phone turns itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true, but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.",0
"Used iPhone with a great condition. LCD Lights leak thru the headphone jack and sim card tray, but still has applecare. so doesn't matter.",1
"They sold it as a new phone but at day 40 it stopped working. The official Apple service confirmed that the iphone was not new, but rearmed with parts from other phones and that several of them were defective.It is a shame that mislead buyers this way. Do not buy this kind of phone.",1
This product is excellent and delivers quickly. What more could I ask for?,0
"The product turned out great - just as it looked in the pictures and detailed in the description. The only thing was that when I received it, it didn't look clean. There was some dirt on it, but it was easy to take off. Other than that, üëè",0
"I like my new phone, but the battery life is shorter than my other Nokia phone.",0
"There nothing to say, this phone is everything I've ever wanted and more, and then the 8.1 update smh every new feature wowed me to the point where I was speechless lol, and Cortina only made it like a million times better lol she met a huge list of things I wanted in a phone before I even realized I wanted it lol id give more stars but yeah 5s the max smh a must buy tho,",1
This item is exactly as described and I am very happy with my purchase! The seller is honest and fair and I would definitely buy from them again. Thank you!,0

My wife loves this thing. She won't go anywhere without it. Thank you!,0

"This is an unlocked Lumia 1020, but it doesn't have the correct LTE bands for the U.S. Its still usable, but I would suggest purchasing the unlocked model from the Microsoft Store which should work well on T-Mobile and AT&T.",1
No scratches looks completely new! No problems with it at all it's been working perfectly fine!,1
I love this device! Microsoft's platform is amazing.,0
"Although the product didn't include the camera grip as stated in the Q&A section and pictures, the company was kind enough to provide me with the grip after all because of that error.",0
"The camera is Stunning, as a professional photographer I was looking for an smartphone camera to take casual shots to not use my DSLR. The Lumia 1020 will let you manually change almost all aspect of the camera (except aperture) to take the shot YOU want, not the machine.",1
Purchased I Phone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked everything was working well the first day! Product came in the mail over to Italy where I am stationed in 5 days! Which is real fast!

I tried to to restore it but the phone keeps going back to recovery mode!,1

"The phone works well. It's not the best, but it worked up to my expectations.",1

"This is my first Windows phone, upgrading from Nokia N8, still getting used to, like the crisp and detailed pictures, the large screen, the ease of use, the battery is not as great and it's hard to hear the phone ring, overall so far so good, will come back and review after more usage. Works well on T- mobile LTE.",1
It's a great product for a great price. It was in good condition and arrived exactly on the day I expected it to.,1
"Phone updates are a bit of a pain as sometimes they don't start or they take a long time to start downloading. The app store isn't as large as the apple or android one, but most well used apps on both apple and android can be found on the microsoft store.",1
I have a problem. The system prevent the latest system update! it tells me that my phone system software had being modified.could you let me know why and what I should do?,1
Very nice iPhone. Refurbished like new. Popular apps good for a starter iPhone,1
"I love this phone! The camera is unspeakably amazing. It's not quite an SLR, but it's damn close. The lens it has is made by the same manufacturer that is responsible for making high-end medical optics. It's responsive, light, and when used with the PD95G camera grip, the battery literally lasts for days on a single charge with heavy usage.",0
This is the worst phone I've ever bought or seen in my life. The camera doesn't work at all; it freezes and won't let you take a picture. I took it in to be fixed and the guy laughed at me and told me to return it asap. He said he couldn't fix it and that I should get my money back. Be warned: don't buy this phone!,0
I'm very happy with my purchase. Everything works perfectly.,0
"I bought this phone for my daughter and she loves it. The phone came in perfect condition. The sim card slot is regular size not micro, which is what I needed. Otherwise I would have had to buy a micro sim kit. Very happy with my purchase.",1

"I'm glad I got this refurbished phone with a new battery - it's been running for 3 days without a charge. I've had it for 2 months now and it's been working great. Plus, I got a nice case for it that has saved it from damage a few times.",0
The phone did not switch on even after charging it for one hour...None of the buttons work....I don't understand how can a seller sell such kind of product....Must be really desperate for bad reviews...,1
"My first review on Amazon. Pissed!!! Do not purchase this phone!!!! I bought it and I did not even get 4mths out of it!!! It's defective..... The phone overheats.... Barely picks up signal.... Battery drains often, does not keep charge. And now it won't come on at all. I need my money back!!!! No stars I would give it but I have to. Smfh",1
My husband is using this phone outside of the US and it works great!,1
Iphone that I bought is broken ( the round button in the middle) and locked. - I read in my order - Factory unlocked - and I don't understand.,1
"The appearance of the phone is excellent , like new. The battery life is good. It had a Verizon related sticker on the back but it is indeed unlocked. It is a GSM phone. I took it to Mexico to use there and got a SIM and number from Telcel without any problems. It works very well.",1
I bought this phone a month ago. The touchscreen is not working and I'm really frustrated. This is a $600 phone. Does this mean I just gave away that amount of money?,0
I wasn't happy because the pictures showed as if I was getting 2 cases and maybe a charger but to my suprise it did not...,1
"Really easy to unlock, I just put in my SIM card and activated using iTunes.",0
"This phone is good for use in Ukraine, but the charge is not compatible with iPhone 4s!",0
The slot for the SIM card was absent and the phone can only be used by T-Mobile. Not unlocked gentlemen. But it's still a great phone in spite of that.,0
did not include the full 16-digit number on the paperwork,0
"I was pleased to receive the phone sooner than expected. There were no scratches on the screen, which was a plus. Unfortunately, the phone itself was kind of dirty and didn't seem to work at top notch status. The home button was malfunctioning; I had to press it extremely hard for it to function correctly. The phone also seemed to work slowly. The charger was bent but it still worked, so that wasn't a problem. I wouldn't describe the phone as ""like new",0
"This is the best phone I have ever used. You can update to the latest version of Windows for free, and Cortana is amazing. Go Microsoft!",0
The phone arrived looking good and working well! I would recommend Wireless 2 Go to others.,0
"The phone was new in the box withe manufacturer films, totally unlocked, working perfect. The iPhone is the best phone, no doubts apart that. The shipment was delivered previous to the delivery date, and apart form the phone the seller send me for free, 2 rubber cases, a set of screen protection and a car charger in addition to the wall charger. Everything Perfect!! Thank you!",1
This phone is great! It works really well and the camera is amazing.,0

Seller promised to send unlocked iPhone and sent AT&T locked phone also the screen was broken when I received it.I had to spend more amount to get the screen fixed and now I am struggling to get the iPhone unlocked.,1
"I bought this from Cell-Source. It worked fine with US T-Mobile (with LTE), even though the carrier is listed on the phone as AT&T. This is no big deal, and the AT&T apps are easily uninstalled. The more expensive camera grip is not included - I think the description would have mentioned that if it were. The phone was new in the box, and my micro-SIM plugged right in.",0
"This product stopped working after just 7 months, and when I contacted Amazon about it, I was told that the warranty was only for 3 months. However, when I went to the distributor (Apple), they told me that the product I bought ""new"" was actually refurbished, so they couldn't do anything about it.",0
"Works great, clean, great condition.",1
iPhone is flawless. But the battery doesn't stay long. Only 12hrs standby long. Have to return it. And bought 5c instead.,1
"This seller is amazing! They were so helpful and understanding, and even put extra money towards expediting my shipment. I would recommend them to anyone. My wife is very happy with the phone - no issues whatsoever. Thank you!",0
"It came as described, ATT branded, unlocked and worked like a charm in Mexican networks got 4G with TELCEL and Iusacell, giving 4 stars because it arrived delayed.",1
This is my first windows phone and I'm happy with the purchase. The camera on this phone is AWESOME! The only downside is the lack of apps.,1
Bought this product on the 18/10/2015 but I am unable to receive any network on this phone. Therefore I am unable to make rregular cell call with this cell phone. I try to find some answer on the HTC support page to find that the item is not even listed on the support site.,1
Did not meet my expectations ! The only thing I needed it for was to receive one or two texts a month. The very first time I activated it it showed couple of texts I received. From the very next day when I tried opening the existing texts in my inbox all I see is an hourglass rotating. After 3 weeks still the same. just a piece of junk,1
"This phone is great! Perfect size, build, speed, ease of use, and camera. Despite what critics say about lack of app availability, there are enough apps! And when you hook up with Cricket (a no-contract carrier) at $40/month, you can't ask for anything more. My worst fear was that I wouldn't be able to see the display in bright sunlight because in the past, no matter which phone I had, I couldn't see anything with outside",0
I've had the phone for 3 days now and I'm really happy with it. The camera is great and I tried a different SIM card (t-mobile) to make sure it was unlocked and it was. 10/10 would recommend to a friend.,0
I was pleased with the condition of the phone. It was better than I could see in the picture.,0
"I'm really happy with this phone. It's in great condition and works well. The battery isn't the best, but it's not terrible. The only two downsides are that the operating system (iOS 9) is difficult to downgrade and kind of slow for the iPhone 4s. Also, the battery isn't that great. I'm going to replace it with a bigger capacity one.",0
Love the phone. Only problem : there are some Turkish language tiles on the phone and I have not been able to delete them,1
I recommend this product to other customers. It is very good and exceeded my expectations.,0
"I found that the rear camera on my phone had a problem where pictures came out with a purple tone when used in an area with little lighting. I discovered that this is a factory problem with phones produced between March-June 2013. The one sold to me was produced in May 2013, but I didn't purchase it until Jan. 2015. I think if the company opens up the phone to unlock it, they should test for common problems before sending it to buyers. I may return my phone",0
Awesome cell phone! Everything wroks perfect and its design is beautiful.,1
"This is a brand new product and I absolutely love it! The only downside is that the battery doesn't last very long; I have to recharge it every day. I'm a heavy user of all the apps available, including GPS (which drains the battery pretty quickly), so that might be part of the problem. The camera is awesome and calls are clear, although they could be a little louder. Overall, this is a great Windows phone with very few limitations. Nokia did a great job",0
"Thank you, excellent phone. I am so very happy for the cellphone.",1
"I just got this Nokia Lumia and I was really happy until I realized that the box had already been opened. The phone is still good, but it's a bit of a bummer.",0
"This product arrived in good condition, but the default screen tends to freeze and overheat when charging the battery. I contacted customer service to see if this was covered under the warranty, but they said I couldn't make a claim because I am from Venezuela and the process would be too slow. Has anyone else had this problem and been able to solve it?",0
"I'm not an Apple fan but a friend of mine suggested i get this phone for my temporal use and so i did.I have only spent a few hours with it since activation but i can tell you already that i like what i have experienced so far,Especially the battery life,How it quickly connects up to the internet and loads the page up in no time.I am not sure yet if i will use most of its features but i don't regret the choice i made.It came unlocked as posted on the site and i had no issues at all activating it.",1
"If you're looking for an iPhone, you probably have a good idea of what you want, and this is as good as they always are.",0
I have had this product for 45 days and it has not worked at all. I have purchased three refurbished products and all three have been disappointing. I will not be buying any more.,0
It is not working. I bought this is for my mom n it is not even couple months n stop working. Not good at all.... Please don't buy it,1
Best phone I have ever owned. Windows 8 truly shines on devices. I will never be going back to Droid.,1
"I got my order a few days ago and I'm not happy with it. I often can't hear anything on the other end of calls, and sometimes the screen just goes black even when the battery is charged. I'm considering returning it for a refund.",0
I can't send MMS messages on this phone when it's using a Straight Talk SIM card.,0
Love this HTC One M7 Gold 32GB phone! It gets many compliments. The sides are beautifully rounded. I just love this phone. It is so easy to use and stays charged for a very long time. Great purchase.,1
The stick for the SIM card was missing and the phone can only be used by T-Mobile. Not unlocked guys. But it's still a great phone regardless.,1
"Phone could not work in loud speaker , phone could not work when headphones inserted. It was such a big disappointment and loss of money shipping back.",1
"This device is great! It's exactly as advertised, unlocked and in good condition. However, the included accessories were not. The screen protector was poor quality and scratched, and the aftermarket charger was the wrong voltage/amperage to properly charge the phone. If you buy this, don't use the chargers that are sent with the device.",0
The product arrived on time and works perfectly with Telcel in Mexico. The price is very good.,0
This product is terrible. The charging doesn't work and the app store won't open. I'll be getting rid of it as soon as possible.,0
phone defective damaged power button and battery back,1
"This is not a Nokia Lumia 1020. If you go into settings and click on ""about phone,"" you will see that it is a different model number. What a rip-off! This is fraud.",0

"Love this phone - its amazing how clear and receptive it is, like the feel of it too, not ginormous or too thin - this is a healthy phone :)...ordered the black on Tuesday night and got it Friday.No scratches, everything in the box that needed to be there. Im a immovable windows phone person, before buying the 1020 I had an lg Quantum windows phone, so sad to lose it but it was so old, anyways Nokia 1020 is absolutely worth the funds. its just stunning and syncd up great with all my accounts.And the camera, yes, yes it really that fantastic.",1
Bought factory refurbished and it's just like a brand new phone! Couldn't be happier with it.,1
"I was expecting the S4, but it turned out to be the S. My wife was hoping for the S4, so she's not pleased with the replacement.",0

"The iPhone I received is working just fine, but it didn't come with the box, charger cable, or headphones. The only thing that was included was the wall charger.",0
"I got this for my husband fr our anniversary and he absolutely loves it, did have alittle issue with the ring volume but had shut the phone off and turned it back on and it fixed the issue now it's been great.",0
No problems so far. Only reason rating is not higher is because I've only had the phone a few weeks. Great for a first smartphone.,1
Apparently has a short lifetime since everyone it gonna stop supporting 2g,0
"I received this iPhone 4 and checked it out as soon as i unboxed it, the screen was in perfect condition and the back of the phone was pretty good too only one scratch in the glass, i noticed that the white water damage stickers were removed out of the headphone slot and the charging port. I activated this phone and it worked very well until last night it started to randomly shut down on me and now it will not come on at all or charge!! I received this phone straight from amazon warehouse so i thought it was a safe bet, whats going on amazon??? we have to do better than this! $260 for a lemon.",1
"the iPhone was in excellente conditions, it was everything that they described at the iPhone's Description, it was delivered at the time that they told me that was going to be, and it was in perfect conditions",1
I bought this used and i was really nervous because it was such a huge purchase. NEXTDAYTECH really took care of me. props to them. the phone is exactly like they described and they gave me a wall adaptor and charger,1
"Its an Iphone 4 and it was in very good condition, well packaged and delivered on time but I ordered an unlocked phone and the one I got was not unlocked. It cost me $100.00 more before I could actually use the phone.",1
This store keeper said he would give me a price reduction for my hardships. A price reduction of $10.00?? I spent that much just sending him BACK his broken iPhone. So were is my price reduction?? He must really though I was a fool twice?? I may have to file in a small claims court to get a working iPhone plus a REAL price reduction!!,0
Received product quickly. The camera is AMAZING.,1
Phone has been giving trouble since day 1 but bf likes it alot and is trying to make it work right. If I had my way it would have been returned...Not happy,1

The battery life isn't great and the phone gets hot pretty frequently.,0
"The phone is perfect, but the headphones and charger he sent me are generic, not the originals.",0
"I bought this for my 16-year-old daughter, but she didn't like the picture quality. She's a future photographer, so she's picky. She just didn't like it overall. We ended up going with the BLU Energy instead, which she loves.",0
"The phone was defective, but there was great service who fixed the issue.",1
Worst phone ever... keeps shutting down,1
"I bought a few of these as gifts and they arrived in good condition and on time as the seller had described. Please note that none of the gifted iPhones were put on the carrier named- they went on the month-to-month plans offered at a major chain store that sell a package deal of buy the chip and get a month air time free. Many months later, they're all working fine- even better than my personal 2-year contract carrier. I'll be buying more of",0
I wasn't able to use the cellphone because it wasn't unlocked.,0
"This phone was better than described. It is like new, with barely visible scratches. There is no damage, and it came with all accessories.",0
"I bought this phone a month ago, and the touchscreen stopped working shortly afterwards. I'm extremely frustrated, as this phone cost me $600. Does this mean I've just given away that amount of money?",0
"I really wanted this phone because of the camera but now that i have it, its become a nuisance.It keeps switching itself off and resetting(I understand its a software problem). Also it get very very hot when it charges. If i had known, i would have bought another phone.The phone and everything that it came with came in good condition otherwise.",1
The condition is excellent and it is an Apple product so that says a lot about it. I really like my new phone and it's new version.,1
"I am loving my new HTC One. It's a big improvement over my old HTC One X+, with a better camera, better night shots, and HTC Zoey slow motion capabilities. The aluminum body is also a nice touch. So far, this is the best HTC experience I've had.",0
i dnt know that this is AT&T UN LOCKED when i booked... it is a new one but a bit different from other regular htc.... i did not get my software upgrade notification AM worried even after spending regular price i did not get a regular new phone :-(,1
"We received the phone and charged it as usual but it powered off while my husband was out of the house. when he came home and we charged it, it continued to turn off and on on its own repeatedly. A factory reset of the phone didn't fix the problem. In the end we sent it back for a refund and ordered from another seller. They did, however, refund us promptly so no complaint there.It arrived in good packaging, but the little key to open the Sim",0
This product was exactly as advertised and arrived quickly!,0
Waster 130 US to get this phone and its problematic . i spoke to the buyer before i purchased tha phone also,1
"got this as a gift for my father. It lasted a week before it would drop calls in the middle of a conversation. That was when it actually got a signal. It also, apparently, randomly called a friend of my father at like 11-something at night. (neither one of them stay up that late).Also, the battery was not that great either.",1
"I would have given it less than one star, but that isn't an option. I ordered this unlocked iphone and was so excited. Then a week goes by and I still don't have my phone. I check my Amazon account and it tells me the phone has already been delivered. IT WASN'T. I had to contact Amazon (they were great by the way) for a refund, which was issued before we even finished up on the online chat.DON'T USE THESE PEOPLE.",1
"The camera is the only good thing about this phone. The bad things include updates that make the phone full of flaws. For example, you can experience the update to Windows 8, which has a chance to corrupt the rear facing camera. There is also a chance that the backlight will turn deep blue, or that the keyboard will be stuck in Chinese.",0
"This phone was supposed to be unlocked, but it wasn't. Amazon.com lied about their product, and this is not the first time this has happened.",0
"The camera has high megapixels but its really no better than an iphone 5s (although it is a lot cheaper!). Programs crash a bit, but other than that its a solid phone and i love it",1
"Second I've ever owned, and I only bought another one because I moved to another country and my original phone provider won't give me an unlock code.",1
"Congratulations to the store that sold the Apple iPhone 4 32GB! This phone is great in today's world - it helps you stay close to family and friends. What could be better? If there's something better out there, please let me know! Apple should be congratulated today - I'm the happiest person alive with my iPhone 4. Thank you!",0
"The purchase of this iphone 4 has caused me so much hassle and waste of time. What a total regret buying this phone from ""mobilekarma"" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, there's no way to get this iphone off the list. I had contacted mobile karma and they have no means to settling or solving this issue.",1
"my daughter is happy with her new phone, the only thing she does not like about it is the camera. The camera on her iphone 4 was better than this one.",1
Great phone but when you call someone or get a call you can't talk on the phone. The person on the other line can't hear you.,0
"The phone was not working properly, but the customer service was excellent and corrected the problem.",0
"The introduction of mobile advertising is unlocked, but they gave me a not unlock! Moreover, this mobile phone when not in use and when to use are very hot, hot, feeling ready to explode same. In addition, the battery is not durable, in a few hours after a full charge, there is no electricity (nothing to do, just standby). So I asked to return, after obtaining the consent of the August 18 return by mail, they receive 20 August. However, it has been passed eight days, they have not given me a refund, did not receive any explanation.",1
"Got the item out by the time it was suppose to be deliver, the saying you pay what you get for applies here. I was looking so hard for a white iphone and couldn't find one at a reasonable price so I went ahead and order the black one new and I got a white one same gbs and all just the color was different and I was very satisfied with the product no bad experience so far.",1
"Fantastic phone. Love everything about it. Battery life could be a bit better, but I wouldn't trade it for the amazing camera. Just too bad I couldn't find a yellow one :)",1
"Updating your phone can be annoying because the updates sometimes don't start downloading right away, or they take a long time to download. The Microsoft app store isn't as big as the Apple or Android app store, but you can still find most of the well-used apps from those stores on the Microsoft store.",0
"This item is great. I'm happy with the condition and how it works, but the battery doesn't hold a charge well because it's an older phone. Other than that, I'm happy with it.",0
This phone is excellent and I am very happy with it. I only wish it were compatible with 'android' applications. Is there any way to make it compatible? Thank you.,0
phone was ordered on a Saturday was at my door with fedex on Tuesday..... shipping estiment on Amzon automated was 45+days I got in a toatal order to my Door in 4days........ Phone Looked light a brand new phone and by new like I payed 500+ was well worth it. love the phone all accessories were in box. Live is good!,1
"Was a ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" item. I wanted to use it on T-Mobile which is on the GSM network. Phone is described as working on T-Mobile and ATT. It is also described to NOT work on Verizon. The label on the back of the phone indicates it is a Verizon Wireless phone.I'm not taking the chance of having compatibility issue so it will be returned.",1
very good a excelent service very conditions una manera muy segura para este tipo de mercadeo lo seguire usando desde venezuela,1
"AWESOME phone! Absolutely love it. Came to me brand new in mint condition. Too expensive, but I had to indulge.",1
"I was happy to see the phone is brand new but have been used a little. Even thoughit states the phone is unlocked, it's NOT. After paying for the phone now I need to pay to get it unlocked. Pretty upset could not use it right away. Over all the phone awesome. I was unable to track the phone but it arrived quickly then I expected",1
"I was really happy with this phone - it did exactly what the description said it would, and saved me a trip to the store!",0
Wouldn't even charge when I plugged my charger into the charging port.,1
"The seller IMPERSONATED that the iPhone was like new but it had a PROBLEM with the MIDDLE BUTTON not working. The back side of the phone looked like it had been open before to me. I was really UPSET with this. I gifted it to my friend and it caused me a lot of horrible situations. And the seller was helping me to unlock the phone which was good, but why didn't he INFORM me about the problem with this iPhone?",0
"I purchased a BLU Energy X smartphone in December 2015. It was an excellent phone, but unfortunately it stopped working after only a short amount of time. The touch screen doesn't work and it's not easy to find parts for it here in my country. Can you help me? It's very important to me to fix this problem.",0
"Terrible phone,even after update,its in a constant state of reset.I have 100 dollar phones that work way better.I recommend you stay away from this brand and operating system,",1
"I bought two Blu Energy X phones, and they are really bad. The batteries are damaged, and I can't afford to buy another one! This sucks!!!!",0
I have had I phones 4s before and believe that one of the best models Apple has made is the iPhone 4s. This phone was in great condition and looked amazing. The seller accurately described the phone and I'm very happy with my purchase.,0
"its a good phone. I needed to get a new phone. so I found this one, only used 2 times. and its my baby. it may not be the lastest iPhone, but I love it.",1
I absolutely love the quick service here - no problems at all!,0
Thank you for sending a genuine product. It is working in excellent condition.,0
The accessories were not authentic and the phone got damaged a week after I bought it. Customer service was alright though.,0
Horrible quality. It was used condition as it but that wasn't the problem. The power button was jammed in so i had to press in super hard for it to turn on/unlock. The camera/camera flash is broken. And the audio mic was broken as well so my caller could not hear me speaking into it. Very unsatisfied. I have bought used phones before but this was by far the worst. I just feel like they try to give you the lowest quality possible then if ur unsatisfied there give you a better version. Going to return asap to get my money back.,1
"Bought the iPhone for my female mate, but I do not use iPhone. A few months after the purchase, the iPhone is still working properly as like new. What a great purchase here!",1
I love that my coworkers can text me for any shift changes or new shifts that have been added to the work schedule.,0
I would not recommend this company to anyone. I got the phone but have to reset it at least once a week. Factory resetting is not worth the money or the hassle of shipping.,0
Best Camera and interesting os system. But other function is much behind Android.,1
"This Iphone 4 was right out of the box ""new"", not a scratch on it. Works just as if I brought it from Best Buy or At&T. My son loves it ,and the price was a great. No problems what so ever.",1
"I bought this phone a month ago.... i have not drop it neither drop liquid on it AND THE TOUCHSCREEN IS NOT WORKING!!!!!!!!!! I am really frustrated, this is a $600 phone!!!! do this mean i just gave away that amount of money?",1
It didn't even lasted two months and it frozed. I'm not blaming the seller on this. The phone is junk!,1
The phone works fine with my T-mobile sim card and looks new. However it is quite slow (and I'm not sure if I've just grown used to the speed of the newer versions) and sometimes the screen freezes.,1
"At first I like the delivery it was fast, but after I open the box the iPhone was dirty I need to clean it first. It is color white and some parts are still dirty I don't know? What to use in cleaning that particular area it's color tan. I just really need the phone that's why I did not return it but I will never ever recommend amazon to my friends when it comes to gadgets. Sorry but there should not even dents on it but it has. Please next time you have to make it sure that you have to surpass. The expectations of you customers.",1
I am pretty worried because I bought a cell phone last week but it doesn't work because it won't connect to the wireless network. What can I do to change this?,0
This camera is great! It works perfectly in Peru.,0
Need headphones other than. That the phone is amazing almost no problems non at all to be exact,1
"This phone is complete garbage. I waited six months to activate it, and it still doesn't work. I switched to Verizon from T-Mobile after 15 years of service, and this phone has been nothing but a huge disappointment. It has zero signal and is completely unusable. I have four young sons that I need to keep in contact with at all times, and this phone is preventing me from doing that. Doctors, hospitals, appointments - I miss them all because of this piece of",0
"I can't give this product a good rating. I'm not sure if it was used because I see two videos and four pictures on the phone. Why am I seeing that??? It seems like it might have been taken by accident during packaging, but I can't be sure. I'm not pleased.",0
"Bought this as a backup until I got iPhone 5. The phone was in excellent condition, without any scratches. like new.",1
"It's a pretty basic touchscreen phone. Didn't notice anything great about the camera and the website layouts are odd and hard to get used to and navigate.Also, i ordered a yellow phone but received a black phone instead.To each his own, but I went back to my old phone in 2 days.",1
"This phone is excellent, especially for its camera and LTE capabilities with TMobile. Highly responsive and great performance overall. I highly recommend this seller.",0
it doesn't have too many fonts. i'm receiving messages in Arabic and the phone doesn't recognize any .,1
"the iphone does not work, its not been 2 or 3 months I bought it and it does not work at all now.. gets switched off even with full battery, and screen shows loading sign with no other display...",1
"I was nervous about purchasing an iPhone 4 online because of my high anxiety, but the seller was great at communicating with me and answering all my questions. I received the phone today and it's perfect - no damage and it works perfectly. Thank you for the great experience!",0
"This phone was a total disappointment. The headphones didn't work, the charger was broken, and the phone itself kept shutting off. I had to get a new cord just to get it to work, and even then it was useless.",0
"Even though the description said this refurbished phone was unlocked, we wasted an hour in the Verizon store trying to get it activated. What a huge waste of time!",0
I took the phone to the Verizon Store in Lexington SC. They told me they could not activate the phone because it is not one of thier's. what do you suggest I do with this phone?,1
Hello I just got this phone on the 27th of January and my phone just cut off and stop working,1
The phone is great and the photos are amazing. It's like having a good quality camera in your phone!,0
"If I could put down 0 stars, I would. I ordered the yellow one and I received the black one. I figured I can use this anyway because I didn't care much about the color. Then when I tried to turn the thing on, it was unresponsive. Even after charging it, nothing happened. I'm really disappointed.",1
"camera is purplish sometimes but other than that it's a great phone! Don't but this phone for the camera, everything else is amazing.",1
Not happy> Bought this as a gift and it will not connect to the internet out side of my house and does not receive picture messages>,1
The phone is perfect but he send me the headphones and the charger generic(no the original's),1
"I have had this phone for a few months now and it has been working great until recently. Now, when I try to turn it on, it won't start up. It just shuts off.",0
The phone arrived on time as promised. I purchased it for my teenager and she loves the camera.,0
"I bought this for my husband for our anniversary and he loves it. We did have a little issue with the ringtone volume, but we turned the phone off and back on and it fixed the issue. Now it's been great.",0
"I bought a power block from Amazon, but it stopped working just three days later. I need to get in touch with the company to see if I can get a replacement.",0
This phone was everything my son wanted. Works great. Thank you!,1
"I am really upset about this phone!! I bought it and there was a no refund policy attached. I figured due to the Gorilla Glass and I had heard great things about it that it would be fine. Well, within a month I had a scratch and crack on the screen. Nokia will not replace or fix it and the seller on here also has a no refund policy. So I literally threw away $300+ dollars. I am not happy right now!",0
Best Camera and interesting os system. But other function is much behind Android.,1
"Great -Very Loud Speaker , Excellent Display , Excellent Camera , This was a Gift to my Mother & Father & They LOVE it!",0
In pristine condition. I went to the Apple Store and they confirmed that it was unblocked. We leave for South Africa and the Maldives for 7 weeks and I will buy a local SIM card. Then I will know for sure if it works.,1
"This was a great deal! The product came in its original packaging, and I will definitely buy from this seller again.",0
"This phone did not work for me because it was for Sprint, even though the description said it would work for other networks.",0
This said it had 16GB of storage...what it doesn't say is that you had to put in two sim cards....essentially two phone numbers to get that storage capacity. It wasn't going to work for me so I sent this back.,0
"camera is purplish sometimes but other than that it's a great phone! Don't but this phone for the camera, everything else is amazing.",1
this phone was bought for a friend first time he have a new one every thing on it is very good for him.,1
"PIECE OF S*** PHONE! I waited 6 months to activate - switched to Verizon from T-Mobile after 15 years of service - and the phone will NOT work NO signal... REALLY!? I have 4 young sons that I need to keep in contact with at all time! Doctors, hospitals, appointments! If I could cram this phone up someone's ASS I would!",1
"I broke my Amazon Echo, and it ran slow. However, it did what I needed it to do when I had it. I lost my first one, so I got this one.",0
"The phone was great! The only problem is that the phone's default language was Chinese, so I was lucky to know someone who could change the language. All you need to do is update twice (amber then black update). I like Windows now; it was simpler and nicer. The phone was truly unlocked! Thank you.",0
"The HTC phone is excellent and simply the best. Even when the phone is used and the back camera fails,",0
Wasn't aware the item was British English. Also unable to use voice commands.,1
"This product had a good initial appearance, but it started dying suddenly and wouldn't stay charged. The battery was probably not good and needs to be replaced. I was mostly disappointed because I bought this for my son and should have tried to return it as soon as it started giving him trouble.",0
Actually sounds good. Not bass heavy but crisp sound.,1
"It's a really cool phone. I switched from Apple to Windows, which was a bit of a ""culture shock"", but I've gotten used to it and I love it. Good camera, nice size, pretty good app choices (again, having to switch from Apple to Windows has included some sacrifices). Battery life is reasonable, but I also use Spotify and Audible a lot. Good volume ranges. Really glad I invested into this one instead of getting another $600+ Apple that I'd just have to update in a year or two.",1
"I love the phone because it supports multiple languages, including Chinese. It's very light and I received it on time. I had some difficulty opening the cover and inserting the SIM card, so it would have been helpful if the manufacturer had included instructions on how to do so. The cover is one piece and you need to force the SIM card cover inside the phone to unlock it before you can insert the card. You can put two phone cards in.",0
Thank you for your kind words - we're glad you enjoyed using our service and we hope to see you again soon!,0
Great !! Recommended !! Awesome phone ! Great features and clear screen plus camera. Also with great software from Nokia.,0
My mom loves it!-comes with a case and a screen protector- huge 4000mah battery (you can charge other phones with this phone with an otg cable)-comes in gold-5.0mp front camera for those mad selfies-no problem running candy crush and other lower end games,1
"I bought this phone for my mom and I have to say I almost kept it for myself. Feels so great in your hands! The finish of the phone is fantastic, the software works smoothly and quickly and the camera is fantastic! I would recommend this to anyone based on the limited usage so far.",1
"Phone could not work in loud speaker , phone could not work when headphones inserted. It was such a big disappointment and loss of money shipping back.",1
"Camera too slow. Cant access high resolution photos/videos, unless you connect the phone to computer.",1
"I bought a used product that looks almost new, except for a very small scratch on the back. The device is working well, but the charging cable does not look like the original one. The cable broke at the joint, revealing the inner wire, but otherwise this is a great product.",0
This phone would frequently freeze up and was very slow. The reception was also very bad. This phone was running on 3g. I ended up going back to my android phone.,0
The xenon flash is dysfunctional and the battery only lasts for eight hours.,0
"I love my phone. I hardly have any problems with it, and it doesn't have many scratches. I would buy it again if the price was the same.",0
After 2 months the home button doesn't work. Took it to Apple to fix. They said it was out of warranty. Found out that it was a 2010 product. YUCKYUCKYUCK!Will cost $150 to replace/fix.Buyer Beware!,1
Good Phone. Functions like the Samsung and Apple ones but for less money.,0
"I was looking for a 32 GB phone that I could use with a pre-paid phone company, that didn't cost me $400 to $700. This phone only worked once I put a SIM card into the phone. I liked how I could use WiFi service to look up things, use the internet for social interaction without using minutes from my pre-paid card or if I didn't get the unlimited WEB card.",0
Great phone just need a option of ear bud pieces because not one fits all,1
"This phone isn't great. After updating the software countless times, it only achieved basic normal functionality. As for the camera, it's not 41mp, it's actually 34. It will save and send 5mp images to social media sites, but if you're passionate about photography and don't care about phones, it might be for you.",0
"Works great, I recomend you to buy reburbished. I have been in the industry for years and I bought this Iphone and it's flawless, fast shipping also. Thank you!",1
"We bought the cellphone and less than 3 months after it presents a problem, it can't connect to the internet wi-fi.",1
"I bought an Amazon Kindle from aucee, and it broke after only two weeks. The screen turns off, and before that the touch screen wasn't working properly. The battery also only lasts for one day even when it's fully charged.",0
Phone... Very Cute & Powerful phone...Display is amazing... Super Speed... Decent Camera... so overall 5 Stars... Love the phone,1
This item is in great condition with no damages or scratches. I loved it!,0
The phone box was already open when I received it and the phone wouldn't charge. I didn't have any problems with the other phone.,0
"Not a new phone! Seal is broken. However, it still functioning well until now.",1
This phone is not working and cannot be synced with iTunes. I need to return it. Please help me with how to return it!,0
"I received the phone sooner than i expected, no scratches, decent screen, so that was a plus. Unfortunately the phone itself was kind of dirty doesn't work at top notch status. The home button is malfunctioning, i have to press it extremely hard for it to function correctly (hopefully it won't become a problem). The phone works slowly. . The charger is bent but works so no problem there. Shouldn't be described as ""Like new"" because it wasn't ""like new"".",1
I received my phone on time and it was in excellent condition. I could activate it completely on my own and it is working fine. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the battery performance is somewhat degraded. But overall I consider it a very good purchase.,0
The cel doesn't work. I can't make calls.. and I can't see my MS.... I feel angry because I paid for something bad... I want my money back.,1
"I'm very happy with this phone. It's always been very fast and the camera is excellent. If it had Android support it would have been perfect, but I don't regret the purchase at all.",0
"The iPhone 4 was advertised as being in like-new condition, but the bottom right corner glass was shattered and the button intermittently works. It cost me $136 to have it repaired.",0
"The product had a good appearance, but it stopped working properly soon after being purchased. The battery likely needs to be replaced. The customer is mostly disappointed because they bought the product for their son and did not try to return it immediately when it started having issues.",0
My mom loves it!-comes with a case and a screen protector- enormous 4000mah battery (you can charge other phones with this phone with an otg cable)-comes in gold-5.0mp front camera for those col selfies-no problem running candy crush and other lower end games,0
"The many apps available on Amazon are great, as is the speed and sound of the device. However, the camera isn't very good and the battery life is quite short.",0
"Nice Device, greay camera , strongly recomended",1
"I bought 5 unlocked phones, it turns out only 4 phones were unlocked.",1
The charger connection is not good. This phone doesn't work with 4g/LTE. I feel cheated. The headphones are very low quality. The left and right channels are swapped and the left is much louder than the right.,0
I got this as a present for my father. It only lasted a week before it would drop calls right in the middle of a conversation. And that was only when it actually managed to get a signal. It also apparently randomly called a friend of my father late at night. (Neither one of them are night owls.) The battery wasn't great either.,0
Item was not brand new as advertised. This is quite deceptive selling reconditioned items as brand new. My phone is already giving issues.,1
"Obviously it's not a NEW phone. There are scratches on the screen. After 1 day, the battery still can not be 100% charged. I returned the phone.",1
"good phones, good cost, but didn't like the packaging although it kept the cost down, so not to bad .",1
"This phone is nice. It came with an Apple charger and cord, and I'm using it right now.",0
Love the phone. Upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the HTC One. Very user friendly. Good price and fast shipping.,1
"Because it's an old iPhone, I thought it would be slow but it's actually very good for its current price.",1
"This phone is nice, but I think the listing on Amazon was mistaken. It said this phone had 32gb of storage, but it must have been a mistake.",0
Came faster than expected. Awesome phone and it is unlocked. Brand new for a fraction of the price!! Only problem is the battery is horrible. It will say 14% and die 1 minute later. Other than that it's been great,1
"Thank you so much for the amazing iPhone! It worked perfectly right out of the box, and the instructions in the box were very helpful. I look forward to doing business with you again in the future!",0
"Phone worked great for the first couple of weeks....now it drops calls,freezesup,and now will not connect to the network! This was a Christmas gift for my teenager...she is not happy!",1
"I bought this phone for my girlfriend's birthday, and it arrived very quickly and was in great condition. I love Windows Phone and am very used to it. I have also bought the 920 and 925 and both work perfectly. The 1020 has a great camera and is very clear. I would recommend this phone to anyone.",0
I love the battery life on the Blu Dash 5.5. The only reason I deal with the smaller screen is because the battery life is so good.,0
I wasn't happy because the pictures showed as if I was getting 2 cases and maybe a charger but to my suprise it did not...,1
"I purchased this for my grandaughters birthday and the day after i gave it to her it completely shot craps. it won't even charge, turn on or anything. she said it acted like it was throwing sparks before it stopped. I have sent it back to the company and still haven't heard anything or received an e-mail. I would like to have the Iphone replaced. I'm starting to feel very cheated and dissapointed. I can be reached by e-mail at phuber62@outlook.com or by phone at 618-286-4929. I would appreciate some sort of response to this matter.",1
I have a problem. The system is preventing the latest system update! It tells me that my phone system software has been modified. Could you let me know why and what I should do?,0
"Phone worked great for the first couple of weeks....now it drops calls,freezes up,and now will not connect to the network! This was a Christmas gift for my teenager...she is not happy!",0
Your product is very good I recommend other customer to buy your product you exceed my expectation.,1
"Unable to connect to 4G LTE with AT&T service after hours in the store on the phone with tech support. Purchased this to replace beloved HTC M7 that should've been the same device, clearly not as advertised.",1
"I love this phone! It's beautiful, fast, and the camera is amazing. I definitely recommend it!",0
"I get my phone this week and people can't hear me when I make a call, this is because the microphone inside it's damaged. I spent 70$ to repair it because i'm outside the States and can't return the phone. Big fail.",1
"This product was perfect for my teenage son's birthday gift! It was high quality and arrived on time, which saved me a lot of time and money. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great deal.Regina",0
I'm not happy at all. I got this phone because it seems like a great phone because I needed to start my own plan and I needed to start applying for jobs but how can I receive a call for a job interview when calling doesn't work the microphone doesn't work. And it will glitch out and kick me out I'm not happy at all!,1
We easily transitioned my father from his old smart phone to this one through our AT&T service. We had no issues.,0
"I absolutely love this phone! I just didn't expect the yellow casing to be in such poor condition, with cracks and dents, and the top left corner of the screen chipped. People say I sound muffled when I talk to them on the phone. I've had this phone since last year and now the audio sometimes doesn't work when I record video. I can't use talk to text, voice command or shazam anymore because the mic quit working. ‚òπ But",0
This phone has been great for the past two years! The pictures are fantastic and I love it!,0
"The product was advertised as unlocked, but in reality I had to pay someone else to unlock it so I could use it.",0
"I am still learning this phone!!! LOL!! I am so happy I made the switch back to Nokia. For a while I was with blackberry (got sucked into the bbm craze lol) but now I am back with a vengeance. This phone is everything you know, expect and love about Nokia. I joke and say this is a computer with the calling capabilities. Or perhaps its a camera with computer capabilities lol. Either way, its a HUGE compliment. I am learning something new everyday and I love it. SO glad I decided to go with Nokia over the Samsung. Totally worth it.",1
"My first review on Amazon after being a customer for over a decade. This is a total fraud, the charger is cheap off the street, as for apple packaging see the picture of attached box and the plastic sleeve it came in.",1
"We bought this phone so we could use the TruLink for hearing aids. However, the iphone will not sync to the Starkey aid as it should. We expected better from Amazon. This was the main reason we bought the phone.",0
"Excellent phone, so happy I bought one. So much you can do with this phone and the camera is awesome.",1
Good evening I'm just receiving this iPhone and it's a Verizon iPhone and it's locked.. I need your help to return this item and buy the unlocked cell...,1
"here in guam , works perfect ,not any problems to activated, , able to work with any sms card and any region, able to download anything , this works fine!! love it",1
"When I first got this phone, I was amazed at how good it looked on the outside. It looked brand new. However, when I turned it on, there were a few very faint yellow lines going down the screen. I returned it because I was worried that this could become a bigger problem in the future.",0
"I had a very frustrating experience with this seller - it was the worst one I've ever had. I wouldn't actually give them any stars, but I have to. I ordered an iPhone 4s box, and the bottom was roughly sealed with some dirty paper to cover the real specs. It was blocked and 16 GB instead of 32 GB. Moreover, the seller wouldn't confirm the return of this product despite my 2 emails to them. I wouldn't recommend doing business with this seller ever",0
Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge.,1
It's a great phone but it was to small for my fingers so I had to send it in to Amazon heh.,1
"I bought the iPhone for my female mate, but I don't use it myself. A few months after the purchase, it's still working properly and looking like new. What a great purchase!",0
Next Time you sell something you should have the box Sealed .When i got this product the Box Was Opened and it said New and you saidyou opened it to see if everything was in the box .Inside was a 16.Gb Phone Instead of a 32.Gb Phone .You tried to take me as a Skr.,1
The phone seems to be working very well no problems it had the storage capacity that was in the description looked felt and worked like a brand new phone so I will repost in a few months letting you know if the status remains the same.,1
This phone looks like a refurbished phone. It doesn't work well.,0
My father enjoyed it. You had the most competitive price on the market so that's why I purchased it for him and also it was in good condition. I will continue to buy from you.,0
The product arrived in perfect condition. I activated it on my Tracfone and the sound quality was great. I highly recommend this seller.,0
I bought it as a Christmas gift and the recipient loved it. They were so happy they might have cried if no one was around. They still love it.,0
"I bought this iPhone 4 and when I took it out of the box, I noticed that the screen was in great condition and the back of the phone only had one scratch. However, I also noticed that the white water damage stickers had been removed from the headphone slot and charging port. I activated the phone and it worked well until last night when it started randomly shutting down on me. Now it won't turn on or charge at all! I bought this phone directly from the Amazon warehouse,",0
this product seems to be brand new have no problems with the phone at all no scratches or dents very happy with it,1
I love this phone. Camera is awesome and I use it to take tons of pictures. It also has a lot of software package that you can edit your pictures or do weird strange effects like nokia cinemagraph not seen on other phones. Windows is doing a great improvement with their OS. I really like it. This unlocked phone worked perfectly for me.,1
This phone is the best phone I have ever owned. Windows 8 truly shines on devices. I will never go back to Droid.,0
"The update process took a while, but the phone still runs fast.",0
I read the review for the seller before I ordered the phone. He was very helpful and understanding. He even went as far as putting addition money out of his pocket to expedite my shipment. I would recommend him for anybody. My wife is extremely pleased with the phone....no issue whatsoever. Thank you.,1

"This phone came to me in perfect condition! Just a few signs of cosmetic wear, but they are hardly noticeable. This was a great buy! The phone was unlocked as well.",0
When it came it had been used before. I went to the apple store because it didn't work and when they looked up the serial number it had been pre owned ( it was advertised as a new phone),1
"This is my first return on Amazon and it appears to be very easy. As far as the product is concerned, its looks great but works terribly. Clearly a defect of some sort...all well, will return and purchase a new one",1
Was surprised that the volume on the phone is 1/2 as loud as my original phone purchased new 4 years ago. Bought this one as a gift and the ring is not very loud. Exterior had only a couple of minor scratches which was expected for a refurbished.,1
"I have owned three Nokia phones, and my second one came with Microsoft Phone software. The first problem I encountered was that the screen was very fragile and broke easily. In the month that I had the phone, it broke two separate times. The phone should be sold with its own cover for protection. Secondly, the compatibility of Microsoft phone software with other useful softwares, such as Amazon, is limited compared to iPhone and Samsung. This was a BIG disappointment for me.",0
"I am very angry and frustrated with my purchase of this phone. It was defective and only lasted for 4 months. It overheats, has poor signal reception, and the battery drains quickly. Now it won't even turn on. I want my money back!",0
The quality of the iPhone I received was almost like new plus it came with its own otter box. It shipped out quickly as well. So I'm very satisfied!!!,1
"Its not a RM-877 it is an RM-875, no 4g or lte and the battery life is really short no where near the spec say. Phone was new, the camera is awesome and the processor is fast.",1
"This phone is reliable and works well, though it may be a bit slow and the home button requires pressing firmly. Overall, it is a good product.",0
"Thank you for your feedback! I'm glad you like the product, it's exactly as described. Thank you very much!",0
I'm so glad I found this phone! It's such a great value - I would never spend $400 on a phone again.,0
The phone is locked and I can't use it. The seller isn't responding to my messages about how to unlock the phone or get a replacement.,0
"The phone as received looked good overall , and worked as well ! Would use Wireless 2 Go again ... Perry",1
"Second I've ever owned, and I only bought another one because I moved to another country and my original phone provider won't give me an unlock code.",1
"Great product, the camera is awesome and the OS is perfect if you are looking for productivity, not so much apps, but runs really smooth and cortana makes it feel like a real smart phone, better than the iphone",1
"
This phone is not functional and cannot be synced with iTunes....I need to return it. Please provide instructions on how to return it!",0
"I'm a happy customer now that I have a great phone at a great price. It all started when I received a defective phone, but the vendor made good by responding quickly and sending me a working phone within a week.",0
"This phone only lasted for approximately 4 months before it died on 3-30-2016. I tried to return it, but wasn't able to. I spent over $100 on this phone, which is absolutely unacceptable given how short its lifespan was.",0
"I've been using this phone for about six months now, and it's the best cell phone purchase I've made in years. I've been watching its price on Amazon, and it's gone up since I made my purchase. If it ever goes back down, I might buy another one.",0
"I took the risk of buying a used iPhone, and I don't regret it! The seller gave me the phone with four additional cables, the original box and documentation, earpods, wall charger, and even a black case. The seller even gave me the Apple store bag. Thanks Hollywood Studio Gems!",0
This phone is wayyy too slow and keeps freezing every 10 minutes.,0
"0 complainsthe iphone came to me brand new....and im using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!!I think, these models come from europe, cause the battery charger, but these people incorporates an adaptor plug!!!",1
"I am new to the Apple iPhone, and I have found it very user-friendly and perfect for my needs.",0
Many people have called with the same problem for this phone - it was nice until it broke.,0
"Each day I become more and more pleased with the Apple iPhone. Outstanding performance, superb graphics, highly functional, an excellent camera, great touch-screen response, thousands of useful and amusing apps, top-notch operating system. Apple demonstrates why she's the market leader with this product.",0
"Even though the description says this refurbed phone was unlocked, we wasted an hour in the Verizon store trying to get it activated. What a waste of time.",1
"Since installing this app, my phone has been crashing more frequently. It also struggles to connect to available wifi networks. Overall, I'm not very impressed with its performance.",0
"Got this on time it was new worked perfectly fine. I would so recommend this to whoever would like it.(Update) I had the phone less than a year and i had some issues. I did get the phone flashed so it could work under another network. After having it for a few months people would call me and i would pick up i could hear them, but they were not able to hear me. So I took it to and iphone repair shop over three times, the replaced the microphone and it still didn't work. I gave up and switch to another phone. Money down the drain on this one.",1
My son had a lower Windows phone before but dropped and broke it. He got this one and loves it. It takes some very good pictures too.,1
This phone is beautiful and has the best smartphone camera available. I have been using Windows Phone for over 3 years and have no plans to switch to any other operating system.,0
"I was unhappy with this purchase because the mobile advertising was supposed to be unlocked, but it wasn't. Additionally, the phone gets very hot, even when it's not in use, and it feels like it's going to explode. The battery is also not very durable - it runs out of power after just a few hours, even when it's fully charged. So I asked for a refund and they said I could return it. I sent it back on August 18, but it's",0
"I dropped it and front glass broke, so I use it anyway.",1
Was worried about buying a used phone. I'm very happy with my purchase. Looks and works great! Definitely recommend it!,1
"This is a real battery of 4000 milliamps. If you purchase this phone , you'll have power in your battery for at least 60 hours of normal use without needing to charge it.The display is a very high quality crystal screen.I highly recommend this phone.",0
"If you're looking for a phone that will charge quickly, this is the phone for you.",0
The best phone I have ever had. iPhone the way to the future. I would recommend an iPhone to my friends,1
"I absolutely loved this phone! It worked perfectly when I was in Central America, and I was able to make and receive calls without any problems. All I did was add a local chip and it worked like a charm.",0
"This review is very confusing. It seems like the person is asking for a bad version of something, and then complaining about broken screens and blue lights. I'm not sure what they're asking for, but it sounds like they're not happy with what they got.",0
"I was worried about buying a used phone, but I'm very happy with my purchase! It looks and works great! I definitely recommend it!",0
BEWARE! I just purchased one. It is not factory unlocked. It is a T Mobile phone. It does not have HTC warranty.,0
Speaker did not work. I have returned it for a refund and still haven't received my refund,1
one of the two phones is bad. Its so bad that such thing could be sold on this great market place.,1
"I have found the camera and camera apps to be great. The phone has automatically updated to WP 8.1 incl. Cyan (8.12.xxx). I have not been able to find the WP 8.1 Update update. The phone has occasionally crashed and required a soft reset, but I have not been able to find a reason or pattern.",0
"Even the most shipper new cellphones i have seen came with earphones and a lumia 1020 doesn't.International version what this means? If they means is unlocked, come on!!!! This came full garbage from at&t / leak of important info equal miss- information.",1
"You are the first person I bought an iPhone from, and I love It! It looked like it was brand new, even though it had some scratches. I can't get over how great it is!",0
It came out really good like how it was shown in the images and in the details and what comes with the only one thing was that wen I got it didn't look clean it had some dirt but that wasn't a problem it was easy to take off but other than that üëè,1
"I have high anxiety so that made me very nervous purchasing an Iphone 4 online. I had contacted the seller a number of times concerned about the shipment, but he was great at getting back with me right away. He answered every question and was very patient. I received my phone today and it is perfect there is NO damage and it works perfectly. Thank you so much for the great experience!!",0
Sometimes Says No Sim When The Sim Is In The Slot & Is Inserted In The Phone . Phone Also Works Slow But Other Then That In Good Condition,1
"The Battery drains quickly with a full charge and the processor doesn't work properly, it freezes and stuff. It worked okay for about 1 month.",0
"I wasubuntu right, I took this to the store, because I thought it needed a new battery. They showed me how to put it on ""Airplane mode"" since I am not using it as a phone. They also helped me set the settings so that it is not on all of the time. They did a diagnostic test on the battery and showed me the battery was fine, it was just my settings that were making the battery run down fast. So I do not use this",0
Phone looks very good. Does have some glitches. Sometimes it will not return to the home screen no matter what. Just have to wait ten minutes or so because when it's stuck it won't even power down but it will let you turn the screen off so at least it isn't draining extra battery. SIM card included was not as expected. The SIM card was disabled and useless. At&t set another for free but took almost a week to arrive. I could have bought same phone without sim card for nearly $15 less. Lesson learned but phone is in good shape.,1
The phone works perfect. My son loved it!!! the shipment is really fast and don't have problem with activating it. Thank you!!! AWESOME!!,1
Excellent phone so glad I didn't waste money on an iPhone this does all you need,1
I've had my iPhone 4 for 4 years now and I haven't had any problems with it.,0
I love this phone!!! the charger is a little loose but any other usb charger works fine,1
The phone was in excellent condition when I received it. It works perfectly and I'm very happy with my purchase.,0
Christmas gift for little sister. She loves it & now lives on it. Now I have to purchase another one for my mom. Its a great phone & comparable to notable brands.,1
"This phone is great! The camera is amazing and it works perfectly with Telcel in Mexico. WhatsApp is also available, which is fantastic.",0
"
I bought this phone because of the video quality, but I have not been able to ""unlock"" it. I live in Brazil and have tried to use the phone with chips here, but it doesn't work. Could you please tell me what I have to do, because it appears to be ""blocked""?",0
"I was happy with the fast delivery, but when I opened the box, the iPhone was dirty. I had to clean it before using it. There were some areas that were especially dirty, and I'm not sure what to use to clean them. I'm only keeping the phone because I need it, but I would never recommend Amazon to my friends for buying gadgets. The phone should not have any dents, but it does. Please do better next time.",0
"This phone is cheaply made and not worth the money. The menu is terrible, you can't transfer data from an SD card, and it can only read MP3 files. Save up and get a better phone. Even an old QWERTY phone from 10 years ago would be better than this.",0
The has a short battery life. I am constantly recharging. The phone take too long to power up. I am strongly considering selling it and get another brand.,1
I'm not taking the chance of having compatibility issue so it will be returned.,0
"Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier.",1
Great product. Perfect phone. Seller sent it with unlock code inside the box as promised... Totally satisfied...,1
The phone is lock and I can not use it. Seller is not answering mail on how to unlock or option to replace the phone,1
it has moments wherein it suddenlly stops at the middle of talkin it turns off automatically. My communication for some reason with this one is constantly been interrupted for no apparent reason.,1
"I'm having problems connecting to WiFi and Bluetooth, and the phone gets very hot and often restarts itself. I love Windows Phone and Nokia, but this time they've really let me down. I don't know if it's the fault of the system, the phone, or the AT&T version, but I'm returning it. I'm afraid to try again.",0
an awesome phone at affordable prices battery is great,1
The speaker phone function does not work well and it is not compatible with some bluetooth devices.,0
"Everything is good, clean, no scratches--however, the battery doesn't hold a charge for more than about three hours at a time.",0
The phone box was pretty opend and would not charge up! But having no problem with the other phone,1
Total waste of money! I spent $179 and this phone wouldn't read a SIM card after 35 days. These refurbished HTC ONE M7's are garbage! I have bought 5 of them this year and all of them barely last past the return date. Buyers beware!!!!,0
Still a great phone. You can't get a mid tier phone that's new with the same quality for the price.The only problem was that The Wireless Circle sold me a used phone that was supposed to be new. It was obvious because there was a screen protector installed by a previous owner. I returned it and purchased a One through WCE and it was actually new. Inspect it closely because you don't want a 2 year old phone that's possibly been used.,1
No words enough!!Got an amazing phone with almost 50% OFF!!! (comparing with prices in US)They even gave me options (thru emails) to choose a different colors!!And they gave 1 YEAR WARRANTY !!!.Good job!THANK YOU.,1
The phone is OK but I seem to be having some problems like the charge doesn't last like it suppose to and it overheats pretty fast other than that if those problems didn't exist it would be a great phone,1
"This product has a couple of models. Mine is 801e (M7_U), made in Taiwan. It's the Asian version. I confirmed the information with the HTC support and with a another number of foruns. It has no LTE/4G support!When I discouvered the problem, I contacted the seller, that did nothing, saying that It was passed the time to reclaim.Seriously, you do not know anything about the product and sold it anyway.Do not trust this seller!The product itself is pretty good. BUT has no 4G suport. By the way, It's not unlocked too.",1
"This phone works great! I received it on the date that was published, but the battery wasn't fully charged and the charger wasn't working. I received a new charger and now the phone is in great condition.",0
"This is an excellent phone. It can compete with the best in its range, and for me, it is the best. It really works like a charm. The camera is good, the screen is good, and the speed is good. The only bad thing is the battery life.",0
"The iPhone I purchased is broken (the round button in the middle) and locked. I read in my order that it was factory unlocked, and I don't understand.",0
"placed in the description that are new, and come with many stripes and details. DealFisher seller",1
"This phone is complete garbage. I waited six months to activate it, switching to Verizon from T-Mobile after fifteen years of service, and the phone does not work. There is no signal whatsoever. Are you kidding me?! I have four young sons that I need to keep in contact with at all times. Doctors, hospitals, appointments - I need to be able to reach them whenever. If I could cram this phone up someone's ass, I would.",0
This keyboard was defective--keys would randomly press without me touching them.,0
"Purchased this product as new. Proximity sensor failed. Apple support told me this phone was purchased in 2011and had no factory warranty. Company will not do any replacement after 30 days, so beware. I have a phone that I cannot use for phone calls. I will not purchase from these people as they state the product is new, but it is not!,",1
Nice first phone for a 13 year old. In good working condition. Just a few minor scratches.,1
"I absolutely love my iPhone! The only downside is that the new SIM cards are smaller, so I had to send mine all the way to Jamaica. But it's definitely worth it and I'm in the process of getting myself a new one!",0
"best purchase I have ever made. the phone came in great condition, maybe a couple of little scratches but that was mentioned in the details box. I love my iphone and have never had a problem with it",1
"The battery life on this device is pretty short - only lasting around 3 hours when using the internet constantly. If you're not using it much throughout the day, it will last longer. Other than that, the device was unlocked and everything seems to work properly.",0
"Since purchasing this phone, it has taken months to get it to work on the ATT network. Finally got it to work this week, but ATT tells me the phone is about to expire (dead) because the screen edges are turning yellow! I thought this was supposed to be a decent phone. Can I get a replacement or credit?",0
No words enough!!Got an amazing phone with almost 50% OFF!!! (comparing with prices in US)They even gave me options (thru emails) to choose a different colors!!And they gave 1 YEAR WARRANTY !!!.Good job!THANK YOU.,1
Everything works great Updating took really long but it's on older phone still runs pretty fast processor wise,1
"wifi, bluetooth connectting problems. overheat, restart itself. I love wp system and nokia, but this time made me really sick. I don't konw it's the system, the machine or the at&t version. I return it and afraid to try again",1
I love the phone it works great. But one slight problem. You sent the wrong kind of charger for it. I needed one for an iPhone 4s and you sent Ike for a 5s or newer,1
"This product is just like new, and it looks brand new too. I'll definitely be shopping here again soon!",0
"This product is terrible. It doesn't say anywhere that you shouldn't remove the battery, but if you do, it won't even turn on.",0
"This phone was a refurbished phone, that was unlocked and I could use my home WiFi to look things up and start downloading apps before my SIM card come from the company I was changing too. I bought a 16 GB because I have a Ipod that was 32 GB to keep my music on and other games I play a lot.",1
"I was disappointed with this purchase because the phone was not in new condition as advertised, and it was not the model I wanted. The iPhone 4 I received had a cracked screen and poor battery life. I'm only using it because I have no other choice, but hopefully the seller will be called out on this next time.",0
"Glitchy, battery drains fast. Screen dims and brightens on it's own. All around sucky phoneToday is June 26th. And now my case won't close because THE PERMANENT BATTERY has swollen. Can't replace it so I guess that after 6 months um supposed to buy A NEW PHONE. customer service sucks so I'm SOL. NEVER ANOTHER BLU",1
"The iPhone was in excellent condition, exactly as described in the listing. It arrived on time and was well-packaged.",0
"Bought the iPhone for my female mate, but I do not use iPhone. A few months after the purchase, the iPhone is still working properly as like new. What a great purchase here!",1
"I'm not able to use the phone because the data signal is poor so I don't get to make or receive calls or messages regularly. I can't always get on to the internet either. I took the phone to my service provider and they programmed the correct APN information and changed some other settings but I still have the problem, so I haven't been able to use the phone for a whole day yet without it giving problems. I had to go back to using my old phone.",0
This seller shipped my used iPhone to my APO address in Afghanistan and it arrived on time. It's nice to be able to buy used iPhones that are in good condition and working perfectly. The phone was exactly as described.,0
I love HTC phones its a good brand and its features are great. Its os is fast I have no problem so far,1
"We're thrilled with the HTC 1 M7! It does everything it advertises, and we're complete novices when it comes to these sorts of phones. We find it very easy to use, and the camera takes amazing, clear pictures. A friend just bought a new iPhone 5 because she was told it had the best camera, but she was blown away by the pics on ours and realized she'd made the wrong purchase. The HTC 1 M7 is top quality all around.",0
"I really like the phone, Thanks It came nicely with bubble wrap so it would not bounce around, again Thanks",1
"Just received my order for 2 unlocked GSM iPhone 4s & 2 Gorilla glass heavy duty cases. Both phones are Verizon CDMA carrier unlocked which is NOT AT&T or Team Mobile GSM unlocked! Also, 1 of the 2 Gorilla glass case came shattered inside the bubble wrap! Rrrrrrrrüò° Only good thing was package arrived in 24 hours only for me to have to return!",1
"12/30/14Bought a ""Used - Very Good"" condition Stealth Black M7 from PONADS for $209 and I am impressed with the condition of the phone since it only has 4-5 noticeable scratches. The phone has no significant wear and it works perfectly.I can only speak out for PONADS, who delivered the item quickly and in great conditions. 5/5 stars for them.The phone itself is amazing as well, I love it. 5/5 stars for HTC.I will update if anything happens with the phone.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------",1
Tablet is as described and was neat packed. Delivery was just 2 days as promised,1
This product says unlocked but it does not work with boost mobile. We called blu customer service and they weren't very helpful and hardly spoke English. It's overall a nice good quality phone but beware you cannot use boost mobile,1
"This phone broke after 5 weeks. The microphone quit working and I needed a working phone that day. I had to bring it to Apple. They gave me a new phone for $150. So I paid a total of $450 for a brand new, factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4.",0
The seller guaranteed to dispatch an unlocked iPhone however sent an AT&T locked phone rather. The screen was additionally broken upon arrival. I needed to spend more cash to have the screen fixed and now I am attempting to get the iPhone unlocked.,0
"When I bought this phone, it arrived as if new, and it functioned and appeared fine with no issues. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather perplexing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they divested the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any",0
"My son wanted an iPhone, but I had just switched carriers. So I didn't want to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon. This phone was in perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent.",0
"The IPhone 4 does the job I need it to do. I use mine as a phone, GTD apps, and Music-Podcast player. I love the capacity. This is not the latest or greatest, but , for half the price I get 4/5ths of an IPhone 5.",1
"Machine learning is making things like this happen more and more.Great speakers; however, the phone started overheating and finally froze within a few weeks of purchase.",0
 I bought a factory refurbished phone and it works like new! I'm very happy with it,0
"It came in the mail at a good condition, was a little disappointed the USB cable and the wall plug wasn't included but overall it is good",1
"I initially wasn't interested in an iPhone, but to make matters worse, the product was terrible! It only worked on speakerphone and the home key got stuck. I was very displeased! I wouldn't buy another iPhone if it were the last thing on earth!",0
"Two thumbs up for the Nokia Lumia 1020! This phone has an amazing 41MP camera and is extremely comfortable and sturdy in your hands. The only downside is that it's not LTE capable, but with a camera that good, who cares?",0
"The mobile won't start up, and keeps shutting off.",0
"I give the iPhone 4 5 stars because it's my first iPhone and I'm really enjoying all of its features. Keep up the good work, Apple!",0
I'm disappointed because my phone came with Chinese language settings and I can't read Chinese. It's been difficult to figure out how to change the language.,0
Great phone. Came before was expected Good pictures,1
Wifi did not work. Speaker mode did not work. Got to get a new one two months later. What a waist of money.,1
Didnt work....the seller took it back with no questions...I will buy new next time!,1
"This iPhone 4 is okay, but I had a hard time figuring it out. It works fine, though.",0
"This phone is not unlocked, or at least the one I received was not unlocked. I could not use an AT&T SIM card with it, so it was a waste of time.",0
I am very unhappy with this purchase. I've had to charge this phone at minimum twice a day and if you like to use apps than much more charging would be required.,1
"I would not recommend buying this older model HTC phone. I haven't been able to update it for days now, and there are many other flaws with it. Get a newer model HTC 7 or 8 instead.",0
"It WAS great for the first three months when I first bought it. üò† Then the phone decided to not charge AT ALL. I tried to get the back of but no matter what I did, the back was a most like it was glued to the phone. So I took it to a radio shack and there was a shortage in the phone it's self and with the back not able to come off the only option was to buy a completely brand new phone. üò†üò†üò†üò†",1
I got my phone this week and people said they couldn't hear me when I made a call. This is because the microphone inside was damaged. I spent $70 to repair it because I'm outside the States and couldn't return the phone. Big fail.,0
"I was not satisfied with this product because I did not receive headphones with it, and returned it for a full refund. I'm glad I got my money back.",0
So far so good. Work well for the price. Holds charge for many days.,1
"We received the phone and charged it as usual but it died while my husband was out of the house. when he came home and we charged it it continued to turn off and on on its own repeatedly. A factory reset of the phone didn't fix the problem. In the end we sent it back for a refund and ordered from another seller. They did however refund us in a timely manner so no complaint there. and it came in good packaging, but the little key to open the Sim Card slot was missing.",1
 0.02No scratches looks completely new! No issues with it at all it's been working perfectly fine!,0
The phone is excellent and my son loves it. The shipment was very speedy and there were no problems with activating it. Thank you!,0
"Overall the quality of the phone is amazing for the price. The screen is very Hd, everything is running smoothly. Would give it five stars but the screen protector it came with did not fit so that was disappointing.",1
"The price was good, but there were more scratches on the phone than I expected. The camera lens was so scratched that I could not take a clear picture. There was also a sticker with the phone's information stuck directly on the phone.",0
The condition is just as listed to be like new and it works well. It is much better than my old device which was used for 2 years.,1
"The product only takes ""Big"" SIM cards, which was disappointing because not many phones still use those. If you already have active service with a GSM carrier, you would need to switch SIM cards.",0
"I was not pleased with my purchase of a used phone on Amazon. The charger was not HTC, there was no data cable or manual included, and the page did not mention that these items would not be included.",0
"The phone seems to be unlocked, but I'm not sure if it will work with any carrier. I currently have Metro PCS, and my sim card did not work in the phone. I didn't get headphones with the phone, but overall it seems to be in mint condition.",0
"I was so excited to get this however:1) I ordered an UNLOCKED phone and the one shipped to me was clearly labeled for Verizon. Right I'd give it a try anyway. No dice.2) the ""flash"" light on the back will not turn off.3) arrived dead, charged overnight to 100%, spent an hour updating the software, battery already at 50%.Highly disappointed, sending in for a refund",1
"Bought this phone in November worked well for first 3months as soon as the power gets low which is really quick, it gets super hot. And it just loves to shut down",1
"Phone was in good shape and working order. With a bit of help from T-mobile to remove previous user information all was well. However, after about 6 months it is completely unreliable. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Battery life is atrocious. Total waste of money.",1
"Best phone ever, good camera LTE with TMobile, responsive and perform really good. I totally recommend this seller.",1
Ok.. Bought it for international travel and it is working fine...,1
"I bought this product and it worked well at first, but after a few months it started freezing frequently.",0
The phone froze after only two months and is complete junk - not the seller's fault.,0
"The home button doesn't work every few times, said it was like new which it is besides that. A little disappointed",1
"This is a very good phone but it DOES NOT RUN ON T-MOBILE USA LTE. For this you must buy the Lumia 1020 RM-877. I am returning this to exchange for the correct phone.Do not believe other reviews here that say the phone will run on T-Mobile. This is true only if you do not want to run LTE. Of course, everyone wants to run the fastest on their own network.If you are on T-Mobile do not buy this version, BUY THE RM-877.",1
"The phone works well. It's not the best, but it worked up to my expectations.",1
"Don't buy this product! I received an awful imitation, not an original Nokia product.",0
I have been using this phone without any problem for a few months. Now I am leaving the feedback to let you know this phone is worth.,1
"I'm not sure why, but the mobile data isn't working. I only get internet when I'm on wifi, but with my sim card in and data turned on, it doesn't seem to be able to connect to the internet via the cellular network.",0
"This phone was advertised as new, but stopped working after only 40 days. Apple service confirmed that the phone was not actually new, but had been cobbled together from parts of other phones. Several of these parts were defective. Do not buy this phone.",0
Just replaced my LG phone for this one. So far everything is working just fine I am very happy so far. I have metropcs,1
"""My experience with this seller has been frustrating and terrible. The iPhone 4s box I received was bottom was sealed with dirty paper to cover the real specks. It was blocked and 16 GB instead of 32 GB. Moreover, the seller refused to confirm the return of this product despite my 2 emails to them. I would not recommend anyone doing business with this seller.""",0
Phone is as advertised. Being used and no issues so far.Delivery was as expected and on time.,0
I'm happy with my purchase. The seller was very communicative and the phone is just as I hoped it would be.,0
"I was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking I was getting a 4S. But when I checked back on the item description, I realized that it was a 4 the whole time- I just didn't read it well.Either way, I have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.I was able to unlock this phone easily with At&t.",1
"The product arrived as described, with an ATT label and unlocked. It worked great on Mexican networks like TELCEL and Iusacell, getting 4G service. I'm giving it 4 stars because it arrived late.",0
"iPhone arrived within 2 days in Excellent condition. I couldn't find the minor scratches mentioned in the description. Unlocked, as promised. Connected to T-Mobile as soon as I inserted my sim card. Activated phone and synced iTunes. I am very pleased with this purchase!",1
"This phone is amazing! I love how sturdy and durable it is, with just the right amount of weight. If something happens to my phone, I would definitely buy this model again.",0
"The photos are of decent quality, but the videos aren't great. Keep your video cameras handy.",0
"Works great, I recomend you to buy reburbished. I have been in the industry for years and I bought this Iphone and it's flawless, fast shipping also. Thank you!",1
"This company offers great prices and great service. Their shipping is fast and reliable, and I would recommend them highly. Excellent!",0
"llego en excelentes condiciones a venezuela, es liberado, funciona con digitel movistar y movilnet, tal cual lo describian en la paginaarrived in excellent condition Venezuela, is released, works with movistar and movilnet digitel, described it as such on page",1
"The woman who hates technological changes really loves the upgrades from 4 to 4S. There are nice little things, that maybe did not need to be done, but they are great. Yet so many things are exactly as they were before. No crazy upgrades or learning curves. I maybe sold on iPhones for life. I will admit my most favorite upgrade from the 4 is that I get emojis-- and I JUST Love having emojis and not having to make them up from characters.",1
If you need a phone that takes really good photos then don't hesitate to buy Nokia Lumia 1020. it's a great phone. No doubt.,1
"Don't buy this phone! I fell in love with the camera and microphones, and the natural black display, but those are the ONLY good things about it. If you like to use apps on your phone (and most people do), you won't be able to get them from iTunes or Google Play - you'll be restricted to the apps that they've made for it, and there aren't many.",0
"This company seems like a joke to me, I got the phone but at least once a week I have to reset it. Like factory reset it. For the money I paid, shipping hassles I had, that is not worht",1
This is a great phone for the price. It will run the latest operating system.,0
Shipped and arrived on time....Item was just like new and as advertised. Getting the 32GB is worth it if you like having movies on your phone.,1
It came with Vietnamese language installed with no directions to change to the right language or user guide to know how to change.The Phone is great. Camera is unbelievable. I bought it for my son who travels a lot. Told him I was going to buy him a really nice camera and it included a phone. This one works were ever he goes. Perfect.,1
"I wont say the camera can be compared to a dslr but definitely it gets closer than any smartphone camera outhere. The windows 8.1 update denim is great. Very elegant and straightforward to what one desires. True, the app market is not as wide as the android but so far it has what I need.ADVISE: When buying the 1020 do it with the camera grip attached to the order. Is worth the money.",1
Was pretty please with this. It was brand new out of the box. I wasn't aware this was a GSM iPhone. Oh well. I mainly bought this to use as an iPod.,1
i was very disappointed. its advertised as certified refurbished but right out of the box the wifi did not work on the phone nor did the bluetooth. i looked up reasons why and i found that the wifi antenna is broken.. everything else works fine on it but after not having the availability to use the internet indoors in most cases and not being able listen to my music i'm already looking to buy a new phone.,1
It is really good condition and looks new. I like it. and I will recommend to my friends. Good one!,1
Having a lot of problems with this phone . Part of the screen does not respond to the touch the beats speakers are disappointing the speaker in my older phone htc 610 was far better internet connection problems and the list goes on an on 1star at least I can make a phone call,1
DO NOT BUY!!! Bought two of these phones and the touch screen went out on both of them.ni warranty and the the company will not take it back.,1
Arrived in time. Product is what I bought. Happy,1
"I bought this phone because I wanted a good camera, but it has been a nuisance. It keeps switching itself off and resetting (I understand this is a software problem). It also gets very hot when it charges. If I had known, I would have bought another phone. The phone and everything that came with it were in good condition otherwise.",0
sucks the screen phone froze on me before i used it .....,1
"Sir, excellent phone, as you told, 100% satisfied, am really content with this phone, and I can now purchase again sometime from you without any fear :)",0
This is the best windows phone I've ever had. The camera is great and it's easy to hold in one hand thanks to its size and weight. I really love the wrist strap.,0
"I bought this phone for my daughter's birthday. It looks untouched - very clean. So far, there have been no problems with it. My daughter is very happy.",0
I am very happy with my new iPhone 4s. It is much more advanced than my old iPhone 3 and I feel like I have really moved up in the world of technology. I am excited to see what the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6s have to offer.,0
I had to return the phone because it wasn't compatible with any carrier's network.,0
"This product works just as well as a new one, even though it is used. I would probably purchase a used product again.",0
"Camera had the purple tint issue. Short of that the phone seemed fine - new, came in a sealed box with original packaging and everything. But the camera issue just kills everything. Cannot take even a half decent photo in low light conditions, without the photo getting flooded with purple. The only fix is to take it to HTC so that they can replace a malfunctioning heat sink in the camera unit itself - there's no software fix. Of course this being an unlocked device, it doesn't have warranty, so good luck.",1
"Only reason i bought it was the camera, but the camera freezes often in video mode. I had to return it.",1
"I was so excited to get this however:1) I ordered an UNLOCKED phone and the one shipped to me was clearly labeled for Verizon. Right I'd give it a try anyway. No problem.2) the ""flash"" light on the back will not turn off.3) arrived dead, charged overnight to 100%, spent an hour updating the software, battery already at 50%.Highly disappointed, sending in for a refund",0
i love this phone i love the size and the strength definitely my everyday device i love it,1
"The iPhone 4 was sold as like new condition, the bottom right corner glass was shattered and the button intermittently works. It cost me $136 to have it repaired",1
The phone looks great and was well packaged. At first I was concerned that the phone was not fully unlocked because it was a verizon phone but everything works great. I dont know why some customers had issues with this phone being an old verizon phone unless they just never tried putting a sim card in it but im satisfied with everything,1
I bought this camera for a friend and he says that after he used it he loved it. The ultrapixel camera is awesome.,0
"Phone worked great for the first couple of weeks....now it drops calls,freezesup,and now will not connect to the network! This was a Christmas gift for my teenager...she is not happy!",1
The product was shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition. The service was excellent and everything was exactly as described.,0
"Wish I could leave negative stars, slow shipping despite having prime and phone won't even charge or stay powered on. My poor son was so disappointed. Horrible experience.",1
it was just like a scam. the phone did not functioning well according to the website,1
"I tried to activate this ""unlocked"" phone with Verizon, but it's still locked by AT&T. My opinion of this seller should be easy to guess.",0
The phone performs great and works on either AT&T or T-Mobile out of th box. I currently have it on T-Mobile. The Windows Phone platform is is the best that I have worked on that integrate for work and play.,1
"It took only two business days to arrive instead of the estimated three to five days. I love the phone; it's great! The only downside is that it came with a weird charger plug that has to attach to an adapter (fortunately, the phone came with the adapter). So you technically have a charger plugged into an adapter plugged into the outlet, which is a bit of a hassle. But the phone itself is amazing!",0
Best Camera ever.....o(^-^)o Will there be a camera higher then 41MP? For now get this one you will love it....^_^,1
I was very satisfied with my purchase. The phone met all my needs and was delivered quickly. I'm going to buy another one for my wife.,0
"Seriously, best phone I've ever had. The camera is simply the best, beats my iPhone hands down. You don't get as many apps, but I have all my favorites and really, how many apps do you use?One drawback - windows updates are a real pain in the ass. Still, I wouldn't go back!!",1
"I sent this phone to my sister in Venezuela, but she couldn't use it because it wasn't unlocked. How can I solve this issue?",0
I have been using this phone for a few months without any issue. I am now leaving a review to let you know that this phone is definitely worth the purchase.,0
Thank you so much for the phone! I'm really happy with it and it arrived on time. I highly recommend it to anyone.,0
I had a terrible experience with this purchase. The phone was not unlocked and the battery was draining extremely quickly. I would stay away from this dealer. I bought another iPhone 4s from the dealer lukki_lukki and it was unlocked and in great condition. I'm returning this one!,0
"The package arrived in time and in perfect conditions! I had an awesome feed back, I completely recomend to buy with this guy!",1
"Do not waste your money on this phone! I spent $179 on it, and it stopped reading SIM cards after only 35 days. These refurbished HTC ONE M7's are complete garbage! I have bought 5 of them this year, and none of them have lasted more than a few weeks. Buyers beware!!!!",0
They arrived on time at my APO address in Afghanistan. It's nice to be able to buy used iPhones when they are in good condition and without any problems. The one I received worked perfectly and was as described.,0
"Service is intermittent, it will cut out completely and usually after about 3-4 minutes it comes back on. I would return it but I already cracked the screen.",1
"so sad that i Open the box very happy with my phone try to put the sim card and it DOESNT SAID ANYWHERE <DO NOT REMOVE BATTERY> and i did it and guess what i just got a phone and wont be able to enjoy, very disappoint guys need to be clear on information with the clients.",1
This phone is terrible! The screen froze on me before I even got to use it.,0
The deal sounds amazing but the home button is really hard to press to work. The heat plate and screws aren't on the inside so you will have poor wifi connection.,1
"The iPhone 4 is a great choice for people who are not as technologically gifted as others. It is more intuitive than other smart phones and has many features that you may not even know about yet. You may feel embarrassed that small children can use this phone better than you, but with a little practice, you will be able to use it like a pro. Once you get better at using this phone, you can even get your daughter one.",0
Could not have been happier with this purchase! Wonderful phone! Magnificent price! Incredibly pleasant transaction! Works wonders on my T-mobile network :),1
I like my new phone however its battery life is short compared to my other Nokia phone,1
"I got this for my husband fr our anniversary and he absolutely loves it, did have alittle issue with the ring volume but had shut the phone off and turned it back on and it fixed the issue now it's been great.",1
It was just like a fraud. The phone was not functioning well according to the website.,0
"The iPhone was in pristine condition, looked brand-new with all attachments no failure, no scratches, everything was perfect .... many thanks",0
"I was not happy with this purchase. I bought it as a gift, but it will not connect to the internet outside of my house or receive picture messages.",0
The camera is fantastic. It is definitely 5 stars. I could not be more pleased not having to carry a separate camera for travel and family events. The smart phone itself is not intuitive. It does not compare to my old I phone. It's not bad and perhaps some of the issue is getting used to the Windows operating system. .,1
" Overall, the phone is great for the price. The screen is high definition, and everything runs smoothly. The only downside is that the included screen protector did not fit.",0
The item arrived as promised and was in excellent condition. It works just like a new iPhone 4S.,0
"Congratulations to the store that sold the Apple iPhone 4 32GB...this device is great in today's world...it solves everything and keeps you close to family and friends...is there anything better?? If there is, I don't know about it. Apple, you are amazing!! Today with my iPhone 4 I am the happiest person.. THANK YOU.",0
"The phone is asking for a passcode when I try to activate it. I bought it as a gift for my nephew's first phone, and now it seems like I wasted my money. It didn't do this the first time I turned it on, and now I can't activate it.",0
Nicely packaged and professionally refurbished. I am total happy as will be my relative who lives in Thailand.,1
"everything is good clean no straches--however, the battery doesnt hold a charge longer than about three hours at a time",1
I am very happy with this phone. It has all the features I wanted and more. The best feature is the battery. It lasts a long time. The screen resolution and camera are both great. I wish there were more aftermarket cases to choose from.,0
"I'm really happy with this phone! The merchant shipped it quickly and it was well-packaged. It came with everything that was listed, plus an instruction manual. The price was great. I bought it as a present for my 18-year-old and they love it. I'm definitely going to buy from this merchant again.",0
Arrived in time. Product is what I bought. Happy,1
"I've had my BLU phone for a few weeks now and I love it. Had an iPhone 4 before which was great, but after 5 years it had a few issues with making calls and was getting glichy. For the price, I'm very impressed. Touch is pretty responsive, speed is good and battery life has been about two days (I use data somewhat frequently). I don't think you can get a better phone for the price. I use straight talk byop plan",0
excellent product. great conditions. just as described on article. works great with my actual carrier here in my country (venezuela),1
"I love the phone BUT ...... The phone for some strange reason couldn't connect to wifi so I had to take it to the phone store and had them fix the problem , so I had to spend more money üò°",1
Bought this phone because it's says unlocked and I figure my family can use it in different different country that has GSM. No surprise it was not unlocked. Took it to a phone company to chek out only to fine that the phone shows up as being block listed. Now I have to return it and my family had to travel without a phone.,1
"Really like my phone. It looks expensive, which it is. I didn't know it was a HTC one7 when I ordered it ‚Äì I was just looking at the picture of the phone and got excited. I wanted the HTC one 8, but I'm going to keep the phone for a year and then probably upgrade to the one I really want. I know there will be a HTC one 9 or 10 by then, and I just hope it's not too much for my pocket.",0
"The phone itself is nice, but I had to return it because it wasn't unlocked as I had ordered, and it was also defective.",0
Best camera PERIOD. It has no lens yet I can zoom way beyond what I have ever have before. Best camera. Best camera phone. Best phone. Only complaint (if any) is that it doesn't have wireless charging built in and that 4K recording isn't possible (yet).,1
"I purchased a phone that was carrier branded and came in the original T Mobile box, but an AT&T phone arrived in an AT@T box. This is BS because my internet won't work.",0
"I absolutely adore it!!! The phone arrived better than I expected, the packaging was beautiful, it's just all around great!!",0
I am repeat buyer of this phone. This is a great camera phone.This is best camera with 41 MP and low light images are just awesome! Phone performance is also very good.,1
"I was disappointed to find that the back camera on my ""like new"" iPhone 4 was scratched and not working.",0
Phone did not turn on at all. Was defective and I still had to pay to ship it back as well as pay for a restocking fee. Horrible,1
Great 1st iPhone for my child! Easy to connect to my current account!,0
"This phone is awesome for the price. My son broke his new zillion dollar samsung s4 or whatever. So, we got him a sweet phone at at great (and maybe disposable) price.We will look to this shipper/store again if we need a phone.",0
"The phone worked well and arrived in good condition. It was charged and ready to go. However, shipping took longer than expected, even with Prime shipping.",0
The item I received was not brand new as advertised. This is quite deceptive to sell reconditioned items as brand new. My phone is already having issues.,0
"I was extremely disappointed with this iPhone because it broke the very first day I used it. Moreover, none of the phone's components were original Apple parts. The iPhone was in really bad condition overall.",0
"I love it, is the best phone I've ever seen. Great to hold, the sound is amazing and Android works perfectly. Do not even doubt, this is the best phone on the market.",1
I thought i was taking a risk on buying this phone. But i wanted a 4 so bad. I read most of the reviews after i ordered the phone. I was worried until i recieved the phone early . In good condition and is working in good condition,1
"This is an unlocked phone with 2 sim slots for regular-sized sim cards. Its main purpose is making calls, and it does this well with good sound quality. It doesn't drop calls. The only downside is that it doesn't have many ringtones to choose from. You can also text and browse the internet on it, although the speed is a bit slow. Overall, it's a perfect backup phone.",0
"This product looks and works great, except for the fact that it won't work as a phone. It's more like an iPod instead.",0
I have a problem. The system prevent the latest system update! it tells me that my phone system software had being modified.could you let me know why and what I should do?,1
Phone was in pristine condition. I am extremely pleased.,1
"This phone does everything I could ever want it to do, and more. I find myself using my laptop less and less because my phone can do everything I need it to.",0
"El equipo llego bien, mas tuve que pagar una alta suma para que lo pudieran desbloquear. no vino desbloqueadode fabrica como dec√≠a el anuncio.",1
"Brand new product, I just love it, only wish it had a better battery performance, so far, I have to recharge every day granted I am a heavy user of all the apps available including GPS (which is a good battery drainer) camera is awesome, calls are clear although they could be a little louder, even at full volume they come out on the low side; all in all a good Windows phone the only limitations are Windows Phone built in, Nokia did a good job at taking the best of the OS.",1
"I would have given this company less than one star if that were an option. I ordered an unlocked iPhone and was really excited, but then a week went by and I still hadn't received my phone. I checked my Amazon account and it said the phone had already been delivered, but it HADN'T. I had to contact Amazon (who were great by the way) for a refund, which they issued before we even finished our online chat. DON'T USE THESE PEOPLE",0
"This phone is absolutely amazing! The camera is top-notch and it's LTE-compatible with TMobile service, which is great. Plus, it's very responsive and performs really well. I would highly recommend this phone and this seller.",0
"I received my iPhone 4 32gb yesterday, but when I installed my SIM card, I realized it wasn't unlocked. The SIM card is invalid. I need to solve this problem urgently. Please help me!",0
Phone was received in great condition. Works very well. This was a great buy. I'm very satisfied.,1
"AS my first iPhone this is fantastic. Easy to use, exactly as described. It's smaller than my previous phones which I failed to research properly.HOWEVER I adore it. I would recommend BluTek to anyone. I bought 2 of these phones and they arrived promptly, in fabulous condition and I was very impressed.",1
"This refurbished product looks good and comes with a charger, even though it is not an OEM charger. It does the job!",0
I've had this product for two years and it's still working perfectly. It was in great shape when I got it.,0
"I was very pleased with my phone. It arrived two days earlier than scheduled and was in excellent working condition. I read several reviews before placing my order and was worried about buying used electronics, something I never do. However, I'm glad I did as I saved a lot of money.",0
"I bought this phone for my mom. She loves it! It feels great in your hands and the finish is fantastic. The software works smoothly and quickly, and the camera is fantastic. I would recommend this to anyone.",0
"Broadband speed only comparable with AT&T & Verizon. Not with my service, T Moble. I consulted with all three carriers and Nokia, but have not been able to unlock it. The seller is very upset, as I am, and withdrew the offering, which left him with hundreds of Nokia1020 still in stock. I don't blame him. He was lied to by Nokia supplier. Otherwise I like the camera phone, and wait for the seller to find a solution.",0
"This phone is great! It's a great price, and it even has a good camera.",0
"I bought this phone for my wife because she wanted to be able to take decent pictures. It does take great pictures and the phone works quite well with plenty of bells and whistles. The only problem so far is that, after just a couple weeks of use, the screen started to separate from the frame behind it. Apparently, this has been an issue with this phone. A local phone repair shop put some adhesive behind the screen and this has fixed the problem, at least for now.",1
The phone wasn't working good at all. Be full charge and it dies any secound even 100%.,1
The phone arrived in perfect condition and unlocked as promised. I'm writing this review from the iPhone on straight talk and I'm very satisfied.,0
"This phone is supposed to be unlocked, but Sprint says they can't use it on their network.",0
My iPhone is amazing and worked right away! Thanks so much for the instructions in the box too. Look forward to doing business with you again!!!!,1
"We ordered a black iPhone, but we received a white one. Luckily, we ordered a black case for my husband.",0
Love the phone..only wish I had realized I have no way to add memory.Bit other then that I'm very pleased with the phone and happy with my experience with Amazon.,1
The phone stopped working after less than 30 days. I'm in Argentina and it's impossible to ship items from other countries in here. I guess it's a waste of time and money. Extremely dissapointed of my purchase and don't have any plans to shop again here.,1
"I was disappointed to find that the phone was not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone, which means I can't use it with my carrier here in Central America. I had to wait a long time for this phone to be delivered, and now I can't return it. It was a waste of time and money.",0
"I received the iPhone I ordered. The problem is that it doesn't work properly - I'm having problems making calls, and people can't hear me properly. I've already tried to restore it, but it still doesn't work. The biggest problem I'm having is that I'm in Argentina (Buenos Aires) and the Apple store here says they don't provide service for iPhones. So I bought an iPhone and now I can't even use it.",0
I thought it was the S4 and it wasn't. My wife wanted the s so she's not happy it was a replacement.,1
I got this for my little sister and she loves it. It works well and looks great. I'll add pictures later.,0
"The initial deal sounds great, but the home button is very difficult to press in order to get it to work. Additionally, the heat plate and screws are not on the inside, so you will have a poor wifi connection.",0
this phone it not good for t mobile because it will connect but after while u will not get service and u have to restart it to get back,1
Phone did not hold a charge. 2 stars though for easily being able to return it.,1
"Great phone. Had to trade it for another item at one time and bought another one, very well made phone",1
It works in my countryIt does not comes with accessories and original boxIt comes US charger Adapter not with Europe standard,1
It stopped working a month after I bought it ... Total waste of time,0
"I'm so glad with this order about everything, from the product to its price and delivery time as well. Strongly recommended.",1
"It's the worst mobile phone I've ever bought. It gets very hot when you recharge it, it's very slow, and the on/off button doesn't work perfectly.",0
"I hope it was just my phone, but the sim card slot holder was misaligned, distorted, and was loose when I got it. I like the phone and i like blu products but just wouldn't actually hold my sim card without me holding it in place with my thumb...kinda inconvenient. Gonna send back in for a replacement.",0
I only bought another one of these phones because I moved to another country and my original phone provider wouldn't give me an unlock code.,0
"The BLU Vivo XI+ is a great phone for the price. It has a beautiful color, fits well in the hand, and has a handy notification light at the top. The phone also comes with a clear silicone case, charger and USB, user manuals, battery, and a great pair of high-quality headphones. It works just as well as any of the more expensive phone brands and I've been a fan of BLU phones for years. This one didn't disappoint.",0
"This phone is great! It came perfect and unlocked, without a single scratch. The only thing is that older phones like this can be a little slow, but other than that it's perfect.",0
"Overall, I'm really happy with my new phone. It was easy to get started with, and I didn't have any problems using my old Cricket SIM card.",0
"This phone was brand new, straight from the manufacturer, and totally unlocked. It works perfectly. The iPhone is the best phone on the market, no doubt about it. The shipment was delivered earlier than the expected delivery date, and in addition to the phone, the seller sent me two rubber cases, a set of screen protection, and a car charger, all for free. Everything is perfect! Thank you!",0
I love the phone. The only problem is that there are some Turkish language tiles on the phone that I haven't been able to delete.,0
"Many people said ""why are you buying 4s now?"", but I just had this need for an iPhone and purchased this. As the result, I am pretty happy about it. It works fine and the phone is brand new. It's delivered very quickly. 5 stars!",1
"It's a strong 2, I got it for the camera. It's works very well. Windows sucks real bad compared to Android. To bad they can't put out a product like Android.",1
"good afternoon my user is velis33@gmail.com I make a purchase of a 32GB iPhone 4 used the day February 15, 2014, I wonder if I'm already happened with the team why not come ah me anything yet and I waiting time",1
"I was looking for a refurbished iPhone 4s, knowing that it would be hard to find a brand new one at this time. I expected it to come with all the accessories, but was sad to find that the included USB cable was for the iPhone 5 and later, not the 4s. I had to find an old cable of mine to use, and the phone worked well for a few days. But then the charger stopped working and I had to find another solution. I hope",0
I'm very disappointed with this product. I expected it to be much better.,0
Thank you for your positive review! We appreciate your business and look forward to serving you again in the future.,0
"I received the iPhone i order.The problem is that it doesn't works ok, I am having problems when I call someone from it they don't listen to what I say, I already tread to restore it but it steal doesn't work.The biggest problem aim having is, that I leave I Argentina Buenos Aires and when I go to an Apple store in my country they told me that hear in Argentina they don't have service for IPhone.So I bought an IPhone and I am not able to speak with it.",1
"The phone I received was clearly used, so I went to the Apple Store. They looked up the serial number and confirmed that it was a pre-owned phone, even though it was advertised as new.",0
"item is the same as described. i'm very satisfied. deliver even on Christmas holidays, which surprise me. full points to me!!!",1
Good. Only 10k of memory. Paint of the cellphone keys falls. The rest ok.,1
"I hope it was just my phone, but the SIM card slot holder was crooked, warped, and loose when I got it. I like the phone and I like BLU products, but it just wouldn't actually hold my SIM card without me holding it in place with my thumb. Kind of inconvenient. Going to send back for a replacement.",0
The phone wouldn't turn on even after charging it for an hour...None of the buttons worked....I don't understand how a seller could sell such a shoddy product....Must be really desperate for bad reviews...,0
This phone arrived like new. It was unlocked so my SIM worked and the phone seems to be working great so far.,0
The phone looks nice just for the fact that it does not keep charge. You need to charge it even without using it atleast 3 times in 24hrs.,1
"I purchased this Iphone from SJohnson236, and they sent me a locked Iphone with Gevey Adapter and ATT Software. I returned it the same day, and I received a refund, thanks to Amazon.",0
"I needed a new phone to replace a broken one and with all the features of my old phone. For the price, this phone is better with as many or more features than my last ""name"" phone had. And the price was right for a fully-featured phone!!",0
"This product did not meet my expectations. All I needed it for was to receive one or two texts a month, but the very first time I activated it, it showed me a couple of texts I had received. From the very next day, when I tried opening the existing texts in my inbox, all I saw was an hourglass rotating. After 3 weeks, it was still the same. Just a piece of junk.",0
The Button at the bottom has to be pressed very hard to get the phone to work. I called the company and they said I would have to send the phone back. I did not have a back up phone so they said the only other thing they could do is refund me $35 out of the $289.00. I took it because I thought maybe it would pay to get it fixed but when I asked how much it would be to get it fixed they said starting at $64.,1
"Just bought the HTC One M7 ""New"" from BuyMe LLC and it clearly isn't new. The screen is slightly damaged, the bottom left of it is slightly elevated above the frame as if something didn't snap into place, and the original packaging differs from what I've seen in un-boxing videos, in fact, it came with a windows phone booklet instead of an android one. Also, the earbuds seem very used, the paint on them is worn and both buds show that they are for the right ear.",1
This phone is not unlock to any network I purchase now I have to pay to get it unlock,1
"This phone is good, but it defaults to Chinese language. We have to set it up as English. Not sure why....",0
I enjoyed this phone. It was in great condition and it works really well. I think that Amazon is a great place to purchase products because they have always treated me right. I would recommend Amazon to any body. It is convenient and I like it.,1
"I'm not happy with this purchase. I've had to charge this phone at least twice a day, and if you use apps a lot, you'd need to charge it even more.",0
Love the phone. Upgraded from an iPhone 4S to the HTC One. Very user friendly. Good price and fast shipping.,1
"The phone had been tampered with- 3 screws were missing, along with the wifi connector clip and antenna clip under the battery connector. This resulted in poor wifi connectivity. Hidden damage was done to the phone.",0
"After a month of use, the phone starts to malfunction and I have not downloaded anything to it yet. By this time, the return date has already expired.",1
iphone was not up to the standards that apple usually has. phone was not original and was in really bad conditions,0
"Good morning, I'm very upset about the purchase I made, which appeared as a new product purchase and really do not look new, I sent them unboxed and without instructions, I assume were hutch devices, they are white and one of they appear with a yellowish white.I have doubts to purchase online on Amazon, E-bay maybe a little more professional about choosing appliance suppliers know them inside your networkregards",1
great deal. came in original packaging. will buy from again.,1
Very good phone. The only problem is the battery because it discharges very fast!,1
"The item was advertised as being ""like new"", but there were some issues. First, the ear speaker's filter was missing. Second, the camera's flash did not work. I cannot understand how they can call this item ""like new"" with these problems. However, I did receive a %40 discount after buying the item because of these issues.",0
Just replaced my LG phone for this one. So far everything is working just fine I am very happy so far. I have metropcs,1
"The price was good but the phone has much more scratches than I expected. The lense on the camara is so scratched that I cannot take a clear picture, also there was a sticker with the phone info stuck directly on the phone.",1
"Best ever! I broke it, and I'm going to buy the same! Recommended!",0
Phone looked worn and had lots of stratches. Bad condition - unacceptable.,1
This phone only lasted for two weeks before it developed a fault.,0
"I bought this phone because it was advertised as being unlocked and working worldwide. However, the phone does not work with 3G and 4G in my country (Argentina). So if you're considering buying one for use in a foreign country, you might want to think twice.",0
Pretty phone but doesn't have good reception. To much trouble to make and receive calls,1
"I was struggling with several other brands of phone before my IT person recommended this one to me. I was very happy with it when I received it, as it more than met my expectations. It gives me all the functions I need, and I love it.",0
I needed to replace the battery as it would not hold a charge for more than a few hours.,0
"This iPgone was perfect for what I needed. Arrived in perfect condition, unlocked as said, and is working perfectly.",1
"This phone is excellent, although the operating system is not as common in Venezuela. It is very good, though. I hope that in the future, Microsoft will place more familiar applications with Latin America.",0
"I was pleased at the product, it works as advertised. I have it for Straight Talk, it was a pretty good deal I thought. The only reason I give it four stars is due to the one hundred dollar price decrease it received almost immediately after I purchased the device. But other than that, it's a very good phone. But, if I were to do it over, I would be looking into the Nexus 5 or 6. But overall, no real complaints!",1
"I buy a smartphone BLU Energy X, last December 2015. It is an excellent phone, but unfortunately with so little time to use, the touch screen does not work, and here in my country is not accessible to find the parts. You can help me, it is very important to me solve this problem.",1
very nice phone a good product but it has one problem that i don't know to solve it the signal network is H and 3G but it hasn't an internet service unless i am connected on an WiFi stationtill now i don't know to solve this problemit is in good situation and very good phone,1
"sir , great phone , as exact u told , 100% satisfied , am really happy about this phone , and i can now buy again sometime from you without any fear :)",1
"Do not buy, This phone does not work, do not turn on or turns on and the charger does not work. another disappointment",1
This product has good sound quality; it is not bass-heavy but has clear sound.,0
Llego well but with the default screen calls chokes and reheated too when charging the battery would give me warranty then could not make the claim before because just a week ago I get the product because I am from Venezuela and slow as I can solve this problem?,1
"Delivery is timely and satisfactory. Lumia 1020 phone is amazing, with the best picture and video quality ever to be installed in a mobile phone. It is simply the best.",1
"Phone looks really nice but this seller shipped one with scratches on the screen. Beware, these could've been demo's.",1
"The phone is good, but the camera makes a noise like a laptop and also adds a sound that's like an air conditioner. When I rotate the phone, the camera makes a screeching noise, almost like an old door. Overall, it's not too bad, but not too good. It's not what I expected it would be.",0
This product did not meet my expectations. I ordered an original Samsung galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language.,0
"I have just bought the mobile (one month ago), so far has been good, however I was used to customize a lot more the way my phone looks like (keyboard, screen, themes, etc) and what I see on the screen (since this HTC has sense 5.5 I can't remove blinkfeed from the main screen), unfortunatelly this phone has restrictions to do so (sad for me), despite of that the phone meet my spectations, lets see what happen later.",1
"Exactly what I expected and has worked out perfectly. It got here earlier than expected and have had absolutely no problems,",1
"After several weeks of use, my son said that the home button stopped working. I told him to make sure everything was working, but the phone part is working.",0
 This mobile phone didn't work well some letters didn't work and cannot write well and Amazon cannot police return. So bad.,0
"I'm disappointed with Amazon. The listing said this phone was unlocked, but it's actually locked to Verizon. There are more and more liars on this site now.",0
I researched the specification about this Lumia 1020 before decided to buy it. So this product has very good quarity.,1
I love this phone! The camera is amazing and it runs smoothly. The only downside is that it doesn't have very many apps.,0
"Bought this phone in November worked well for first 3months as soon as the power gets low which is really quick, it gets super hot. And it just loves to shut down",1
"- Works with Straight Talk.- LTE, 4G, 3G, etc all work just fine.- Ships with windows 8.0- Can be updated to 8.1 for free.- Cortana personal assistant is part of 8.1I use the Straight Talk AT&T sim card, and it works great. There seems to be confusion reg",0
"It's an awesome device with great performance. Screen quality is beautiful and the camera speaks for itself. Personally I am a fan of the Windows OS but the lack of apps is a drawback. Overall though, the phone was in great condition and has met all my needs Five stars for sure",1
I like the phone but when I call somebody and I can hear them but they can not hear me. That sucks cuz I like to talk to people more than texting. Like I can't call work when I'm going to be late. I would have to text someone who going to work that day so they can say that I going to be late.,1
I was very pleased with the camera I purchased from Amazon. It arrived within two days and was brand new and in pristine condition. I simply transferred my SIM card over and it was good to go. Thank you!,0
I don't know why everyone is dissing this phone mine came perfect and unlocked. It didn't have a single scratch. The only thing is when you buy older phones like this they're a little slow but besides that perfect.,1
Very disappointed with the Iphone 4s I get. Its battery is desperately unfuntional- it can stand by only few hours after being full charge.,1
"Excellent smartphone. If you want a economic and good smartphone, this is perfect and for me the most important the battery duration is really good. I turn on it at 5.00am and turn off 9.30pm with 30% of battery (aprox). Good quality photos and videos. Beautiful design and very solid. 3G and 4G in Venezuela is good.",1
"This is a very good phone but it DOES NOT RUN ON T-MOBILE USA LTE. For this you must buy the Lumia 1020 RM-877. I am returning this to exchange for the correct phone. Do not believe other reviews here that say the phone will run on T-Mobile. This is true only if you do not want to run LTE. Of course, everyone wants to run the fastest on their own network.If you are on T-Mobile do not buy",0
"I ordered two phones and one of them didn't have an external sim port, so I can't return it. I'm really bummed out about it.",0
"The condition of the phone was unacceptable, with lots of scratches and wear.",0
Phone has been giving trouble since day 1 but bf likes it alot and is trying to make it work right. If I had my way it would have been returned...Not happy,1
"Service is intermittent, it will cut out completely and usually after about 3-4 minutes it comes back on. I would return it but I already cracked the screen.",1
"This phone came quickly! It said it was ""like new"" and it seemed completely new--had the plastic on the front, etc. It had no scratches, etc. We ordered this phone for my daughter and she was totally excited. This came from the Amazon Warehouse and I would certainly recommend ordering from them. It included the headphones which was great also.",1
I do not recommend this seller. The phone has problema since I bought it. When you make o receive calls the other person did not listen and now sometimes tve touch screen does not work well. I contact HTC and they told me the problem os the phone.,1
CAREFULL!I just bought one.It is not factory unlock.It is a T Mobile phone.It dosn't have HTC warranty.,1
excellent product. great conditions. just as described on article. works great with my actual carrier here in my country (venezuela),1
"I've had my BLU phone for a few weeks now and I love it. Had an iPhone 4 before which was great, but after 5 years it had a few issues with making calls and was getting glichy. For the price, I'm very impressed. Touch is pretty responsive, speed is good and battery life has been about two days (I use data somewhat frequently). I don't think you can get a better phone for the price. I use straight talk byop plan and works great.",1
"Had a broken antenna so it wouldnt send or receive phone calls, texts, and had terrible data and wifi reception.",1
"I'm sorry to say that I have to return this phone. I finally determined that the bottom speaker does not work. It was a lengthy process to discover this. I also noticed that it doesn't ring when it's in my pocket. Otherwise, it's a pretty decent small phone (which is what I was after to begin with). I may try another one...?",0
"I've had this phone for a couple of months now, it is my first smartphone, and I absolutely love it.",1
"Excelent product, excellent condition and even better price. I don't miss anything from the 6",1
"The phone is good, but you can't talk on it when you make or receive a call. The person on the other line can't hear you.",0
I have had problems with network connections and screen malfunctions since I got this phone.,0
"The rear camera has an issue where pictures come out with a purple tone when used in an area with little lighting. I found that this is a factory problem with phones produced between March-June 2013. The one sold to me was produced in May 2013, I purchased it on Jan. 2015...I think if they were able to open it to unlock it, they should test the common problems before sending to buyers; I may return it...",0
"Camera had the purple tint issue. Short of that the phone seemed fine - new, came in a sealed box with original packaging and everything. But the camera issue just kills everything. Cannot take even a half decent photo in low light conditions, without the photo getting flooded with purple. The only fix is to take it to HTC so that they can replace a malfunctioning heat sink in the camera unit itself - there's no software fix. Of course this being an unlocked device, it doesn't have warranty, so good luck.",1
"Phone was not unlocked.I was referred to Apple. Apple said, 2 service techs, the phone was still locked to the Cloud. The prices quoted to have device unlocked in the $50 to $200 range. With no guarantee of success.Due to circumstances, the phone was a gift to someone out of the country, I am out the money.",1
This Iphone is on IOS 7.02 I tried so many time to update to current IOS but it won't work. Also iphone 4 camera is pretty bad I can't video call or record videos clear nor can I take selfies clear its blurry. I was expecting better quality iphone for What I have paid but this is so bad iphone. Very disappointed,1
Do Not BUY!!! This is NOT an unlocked phone. I can't believe Amazon would put up with this.,0
This product is exactly as described. I've been using it for a few weeks now and haven't had any issues.,0
The phone is absolutely perfect. It was able to do everything I needed it to do plus much more. Hopefully I can find a 5 at a great price so I can upgrade,1
"I just ordered the iPhone 4, it is my first time, so i'm really nervous about it, i'm hoping that it does not come in with defects all over it. I really need it to be good cuz it's a present, just like I said before` I really am hoping for the best. It's estimated to come on the 6th of December. So I'll let you guys know more about it once it comes in.",1
"The camera on this phone sometimes has a purple tint, but other than that it's a great phone! Don't buy this phone for the camera, everything else is amazing.",0
"This phone broke after 5 weeks the microphone quit working and I needed a working phone that day, I had to bring it to Apple, they gave me a new phone for $150, so add this to the $300 I paid for this phone so I got a brand new factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4 for $450 which is ok.",1
Ok.. Bought it for international travel and it is working fine...,1
 item was new and as advertised. getting the 32gb is worth it if you like having movies on your phone.,0
"I recieved the product pretty quick, and its in good condition turns on and works great for the price I paid I am happy.",1
"This product is great, but some reviewers have noted that it lacks expandable memory and HDMI support.",0
front face camera isn't the best but I plan on taking this phone overseas and it is a great buy for that.,1
The phone has functioned as advertised. The beats audio is incredible!,1
"A light scratch on the back cover of the phone, otherwise I would have given all 5 stars. Rest looks almost new.",1
"The battery drains very quickly when you use the phone for gaming or other intensive activities, and takes a long time to charge back up. The phone also gets quite hot during use. Other than those issues, the phone is good and has an excellent camera.",0
"This phone is terrible and Blu is the worst company I have ever dealt with. The phone failed after a week, it just powered off and never went back on. I returned it under the warranty, and they couldn't replace the same model, so I had to accept a different one. I never got the replacement one and they are not even going to file a claim with the mail company to try to find it. They don't care at all about the customer. Do not buy Blu",0
"Worst!!!Worst!!!Worst...this is not a new phone and it's unlocked AT&T, phone comes with improper packing normal cartron box,After 15 days usage phone charge has defected, now charger is not working, waste of money, do not recommended this seller, since the item is not what they described.",1
"This phone replaced an insane Nokia 920 that was a ""rebuilt"" phone. Best Nokia phone I have had yet.",1
"The phone was in perfect shape! I got a sim card from at&t and now its prepaid. I love this thing. The camera is STUNNING. I got a handful of the best photo apps, fantasia, phototastic, and the selfie cam from Nokia. All this together turns this thing onto a beast. Can't recommend this enough.",1
Like the product but it didn't work right so I returned it. Decided to keep old phone.,1
DO NOT BUY!!! Bought two of these phones and the touch screen went out on both of them.ni warranty and the the company will not take it back.,1
It was totally the wrong phone!!! Out was advertised as being an unlocked phone capable of activation on any GSM provider. The fact was however that this phone would only be able to work with CDMA. So long story short is that I wasted $200 on a phone that would not work as advertised.Thanks a lot,1
"I used to have an s3 and I was not sure about moving to s4. I chose HTC One and I do not regret it. The phone is metal made, feels solid, and works perfect. S3 was much more plastic.It's a little overpriced - you can find it at $599 in the HTC store, but they take US credit cards only.It's unlocked, I put my chilean sim card and worked as a charm.Excellent product!",1
"Phone was as described, battery life is good. Overall a very quality product!",0
The phone I purchased said it was carrier branded and comes in the original t mobile box...but instead an at&t phone arrived in an at@t box...this is some nonsense because my internet won't work.,0
"I get my phone this week and people can't hear me when I make a call, this is because the microphone inside it's damaged. I spent 70$ to repair it because i'm outside the States and can't return the phone. Big fail.",1
I have had I phones 4s before and feel one of the best models Apple had made. This phone was in great shape while looking so slick. The seller had described the phone exactly the way it is and I'm very happy with my purchase,1
"Great phone, brand new.. Arrived more quickly than expected.. This phone has no carrier logo (att, tmobile.. et)... I inserted my carrier's sim card and away it goes.. Perfect",0
"This phone is easy to use and simple, and it works great with the Movilnet carrier in Venezuela. Well done, Blu!",0
Great product met all my expectationsWould buy again 5 stars,1
I did my research on the specifications of the Lumia 1020 before deciding to buy it. So this product has very good quality.,0
I highly recommend this product - it works like a charm! I'll definitely be buying it again.,0
"First off, the phone is fantastic. Get one. However, the unit Amazon sent has an unlocked Australian/New Zealand product code. You wouldn't notice except that Cortana is not released for this region yet. So while we have the 8.1 update, it did not enable Cortana. We can wait or go through a challenging ROM flashing to get it to the US.",0
Was suppose t be unlocked but showed up locked and way more scratches than it was portrayed not very happy may have to return,1
This is my first smart phone and I absolutely love it! The camera is amazing and puts all other smart phone cameras to shame.,0
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IF THE IPHONE IS UNLOCKED ? I AM FROM VENEZUELA AND ME KNOW IF I WANT MY COUNTRY IS IN GOOD BUY IT NOW SO I HOPE YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU!,1
"This phone is great! I got the camera grip from the seller as an extra, and it's really helped me take some great pictures.",0
i bought it for a xmas gift. I think he would have cried if no one was in the room. he was that happy. and loves it still,1
This phone is really great. I've had it for almost a week now and I'm still really impressed. It's the perfect phone for anyone who wants a good smartphone experience. The pictures it takes are absolutely beautiful and the detail is just amazing. I would definitely give this phone a 10/10.,0
Great speakers but the phone started overheating & finally just froze within a few weeks of purchase.,1
"Overall, the chat bot seems to work well. The battery may not hold a charge as long as I would like, but it is still a good product.",0
I wasn't aware that the item was British English. I also couldn't use voice commands.,0
"This item looked almost new when I received it, with only a few visible scratches. The front and back looked like it was brand new, and it works great! Thank you so much!",0
"Sending it back. Apps can not download as this phone can only take up to ios 7, and all the new apps are now using ios 9",1
"I returned my phone after the return window ended, and it stopped working completely! The speaker, microphone, and headphone jack all stopped working. I'm very unhappy with this product.",0
"This phone consume a lot of battery power at first, after downloaded the new OS software, I have no more problem with the phone. Good condition as vendor description. The HTC charger does not work. Lucky I have the same charger from my broken phone.",1
HAD THE PHONE FOR 5 WEEKS AND THE PHONE IS DEAD! TOO LATE TO RETURN OR EXCHANGE IT! Good way to get my money!,1
"This is a great item. I am pleased with the condition as well as the operation of it, however the battery reflects the age of the device. Besides the battery depleting its charge rather quickly I am happy with this phone.",1
does not come in box that is bad not wash brings to insert the sim card and cash are not nuebo are usedotherwise and binding to and release for Latin America if it do not work,1
The speaker phone doesn't work and it doesn't connect to some bluetooth device (earpiece),1
Dear BenI am happy with the Nokia Lumia 1020 I bought from you. It is what I expected. I am having the best pictures captured by this phone. The condition was good. Definitely will recommend friends to do business with Ben.,1
"I bought this phone because it said it was unlocked, so I thought my family could use it in different countries that have GSM service. But it wasn't unlocked, and when I took it to a phone company to check, they said it was blocklisted. So now I have to return it and my family had to travel without a phone.",0
"Great phone,,but my speakers don't work, I can't hear anything from it without a headset.",1
"Good phone, but if you can find a N5 go for that instead. if I bought this for my self I would of returned it becaue all the AT&T crapwear.. You will need to root it to remove all that bloatwareProsAluminum backfastGood StorageCons:full and I mean fulll of AT&T bloatware crap!",1
I had to pay a service to unlock it. And it really took time to and money to finally fix it,1
I really like this phone. I like the size and the strength. I definitely use it every day.,0
"Beautiful phone, with the best smartphone camera available. I've been using Windows Phone for over 3 years and will not gladly switch to any other OS.",1
"This is an excellent smartphone. If you want an economic and good smartphone, this is perfect. For me, the most important thing is the battery duration, which is really good. I turn it on at 5.00am and turn it off at 9.30pm with 30% of the battery remaining (approximately). The photos and videos are of good quality. The design is beautiful and it is very solid. 3G and 4G in Venezuela is good.",0
I do not recommend this phone or operating system. I have had 100 dollar phones that work better.,0
"In less than 2 months, my phone got stuck in earphones mode. I must have used the earphones twice at most. So now I can't hear anything unless an earphone is plugged in. I can't return or exchange the item anymore. It's pathetic that a wanna-be flagship phone has such cheap quality. I'll never buy Nokia or Microsoft again.",0
Its an iphone with siri! Love her! I easily switched my crappy cricket LG 90 over to the phone by just inserting my sim card and transferred my data using the copy my data app. For under $80 why would you buy anything else? It works great and does everything . I am LMAO at my friends over face time who paid $700 for their iphone and over $100 a month for a service and data. Theirs doesn't do much more than my $70 refurbished 4s.,1
"Although this phone did not come with the original accessories, it seems to be working fine for my teenager. The exterior is in excellent shape. I will update when I take it to our carrier.",0
I really love my new phone and the funny part is i use it like every sec. lol thank you for the phone,1
excelente vendedor desde venezuela todo perfecto gran telefono sin detalle alguno llego en el tiempo estimado en excelentes condiciones gracias,1
"The service is unreliable and often cuts out completely. I would return the product, but I already damaged the screen.",0
This Phone is great! you should try one and see for yourself!,0
"If you love high quality compact cameras and don't want to carry around a bulky DSLR, this is the product for you! I have not regretted getting it one bit. It's fantastic!",0
"My htc came in a brand new package factory seal charger,usb,phone, manual book .The phone is brand new i 've been using them for over 3 weeks already never has problem .Hardware software are great never froze on me yet .Planning to buy another one soon.The price is no complain and i have tmobile data text and internet everything is all functions.",1
"I did not receive 2 batteries maybe you will. You must buy a storage card to do anything, I wish I knew this when I made the purchase.",1
"I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH MY PURCHASE, THE PHONE MET ALL MY NEEDS. IT WAS DELIVERED QUICKLY AND WORKED AS PROMISED, I'M GOING TO BUY ANOTHER FOR MY WIFE.",1
"The phone itself was great. Until it broke (buttons stopped working) after 3 months. Then I discovered that it was out of warranty, because it was NOT new as stated.This was a ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" seller. It doesn't matter. They are no better than every other seller out there lying about their merchandise. And all Amazon can do is issue a refund.",1
Wasn't unlocked like it said it was.... Don't buy this. It's a waste of money..,1
"The phone is good, but when you make or receive a call, the person on the other end can't hear you.",0
"because the iphone is fiddled,,, and has many damaging and this product is not fit for the work he cheatDishonest seller and I have sold my iPhone 4 32 GB and has many malfunction in the device like Sbakr and headsets and order",1
You sold a phone that the battery won't stay charged for longer then an hour,1
"I absolutely love this phone! The price is a steal, and Amazon's customer service is excellent. I am a very satisfied customer!",0
"Excellent phone... Little, comfortable. Its a perfect basic phone",1
The bottom center button often will not engage. When the button is pressed the phone often does not respond. I think that the button is dying. It is not working full.It is not the end of the world but a bit disappointing.,1
You sold me a phone with a defective battery. It won't charge for more than an hour.,0
"I had to return this phone because it wasn't unlocked as I'd ordered, and it was also defective. However, it's a very nice phone.",0
Phone arrived as advertised.Can't use phone as a hot spot like I did with my Android.Also can't download all the apps like my Android.,1
"The Iphone has minor scratches as described.Unfortunately,the item is not even recognized by my Mac Book Pro ,when I connect to the usb port.When I turn the phone and insert the SIM,it's asking me for a code.The phone is blocked, and locked and I am not able to use it.I am really devastated by this situation.",1
Works looks and my wife is very happy with it. Thank you. She won't go any where with out it.,1
Extremely disappointing i ordered this phone but the center button was not working and too slow,1
"I was very disappointed with my purchase. The phone was advertised as being certified refurbished, but the WiFi and Bluetooth did not work right out of the box. I looked up reasons why and found that the WiFi antenna is broken. Everything else works fine on the phone, but after not being able to use the internet indoors in most cases and not being able to listen to my music, I'm already looking to buy a new phone.",0
Wonderful device. Just appreciate the Microsoft platform.,1
"This phone overheated after being left in a hot car, and the battery got stuck to the phone. It took 5 hours to fully charge the phone. Had to get a new phone.",0
the description of the telephone was that it was a telephone released by to that buys it reason when arrives the telephone to me that him introdusco sim card does not serve because only it is possible to be used for AT& T deberia to demand it to sell articles that do not have a correct description if I wanted a telephone of AT& T I buy it to AT& T and not to a swindler,1
"This iPhone is complete garbage and not worth your money. I've had it for two weeks and it's been nothing but trouble. The audio doesn't work most of the time, it doesn't connect to Wi-Fi, the Safari app crashes constantly, and the battery drains quickly once it reaches 50%. Save yourself the trouble and just buy a new one.",0
"This phone is terrible. It keeps freezing and resetting, and the narrator feature won't work. The camera is good, but overall this phone isn't worth it. Nokia messed up on this one.",0
great phone for price. will run latest operating system.,1
I'm very pleased with this product! It looks brand new and there are no problems with the phone whatsoever. No scratches or dents. Very happy with it.,0
"Fantistic Camera, one of the best if you look at the reviews....and I will agree! Small enough to fit in my pocket but big enough to browse the web.",1
"I fine this phone to be very well made, and it's loaded. I had a android phone before my iPhone, if I had to rate the difference I would pick this phone first. This phone is much more sophisticated, but people friendly.",1
I needed to step into the smartphone world for work and my ATT plan was not up yet. I checked everywhere and Amazon had the best prices and the best guarantees. This phone was in superb condition and I am loving it!,1
"Almost to years with this phone, it works great and fantastic pictures ! Love it",1
This product is excellent! It is easy to operate and has a magnificent camera with 41 megapixels.,0
Hello! Acquire thisApple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished)¬†product and the same presentaa problem with the handset (not olle ) what is the procedure to enforce the guarantee,1
" I'm not happy at all. I got this phone because it seems like a great phone, but I'm having a lot of trouble with it. The microphone doesn't work, so I can't receive calls, and it keeps glitch and kicking me out. I'm not happy at all!",0
"Looks great and is easy to use and update the software, but you have to be careful how you hold it or you attenuate the antenna and don't get much signal.",1
The product is by far superior in overall performance.It is very sleek and fits modern tech. toys category/must have tech toys.The shipper sent a complete package with no missing accessories which is my biggest rave.,1
"The phone is refurbished.Initially the phone worked fine, but after a few weeks of use the phone start to fail. It constantly rebooted without reason. I take to a HTC service and they told me that the phone wasn't new.I lose my money with this phone. Don't buy it",1
"It's exactly as was described! I love it! It looks brand new! Came super fast and the sender was very easy to communicate with! On top of that, it was actually a 32 GB phone. The price was more than a deal! I would by from them again.",1
This is an excellent product and I highly recommend it!,0
This phone worked for 2 months and then we started having problems with the speaker. Now the phone doesn't work correctly at all. We tried the online fixes but they didn't work. We spent too much money for something that only worked for a month.,0
"I absolutely love this phone. It is easy to use and very intuitive. I had a momentary panic when I saw that the phone came in Chinese and the manual was in Chinese, but I was able to decipher how to set it to English within minutes of powering it on. I wish the description had included this information, but it was not a major hassle. I would buy this phone again!",0
I'm having trouble with the touch screen on my ChatGPT device. I can't seem to factory reset it so that I can return it.,0
It looked fine but after a couple of days there was no media sound. It went into head set mode and I couldn't reset it back to normal. Hardware problem????,0
I love this phone! It has exceeded my expectations and the camera is just fantastic!,0
"The iPhone 4s arrived looking like new! I can't find a single scratch on it and it's running perfectly. The battery life could be better, but overall I'm very pleased.",0
"I purchased this phone from FGSTrading and the phone is the international version & factory unlocked. Works well in my country. Most important part of this phone is the stunning looks.. even a iphone is going to feel shy infront of this beauty. And then there is no comparison of its screen and sound. This phone simply got the best screen out there (468 ppi) as well as the boom sound. It feels so good in hands giving a royal feeling. The new HTC One M8 is also launched but I still prefer M7, the design of this phone is so good which you wont find in any other phone.",1
Great chance to get a teens first iPhone!,1
Everything works well phone looks almost brand new however I recieved the wrong charger port.,1
This is a great product at a great price. It was in excellent condition and arrived exactly on the day I expected it to.,0
This is a very nice product. It arrived as I expected and I would recommend it. The quality is 95% and we've had no trouble using it at all. 100% ok.,0
"The phone arrived with the wrong charger and no instructions. I have told you this before, so please do not bother me again.",0
"I bought this phone to use as a secondary phone, and it worked great. Now I only use it as a backup phone, but I'm glad I have a phone to go to in case of emergencies.",0
great product would buy again and will when necessary,1
it worst mobile phone I had bougth in my life so bad when i recharge it the mobile phone became very hot it is very slow and off/on button does not work perfectly,1
I was happy with my purchase and the seller even threw in a camera grip as an extra bonus! The phone is great.,0
The product was defective and the camera did not work. I was disappointed and would not recommend it.,0
"I'm so sad that I opened the box and found my new phone. I was excited to try it out, but when I went to insert the SIM card, I saw a note that said ""DO NOT REMOVE BATTERY."" I did it anyway, and now my phone is useless. I'm very disappointed. The company needs to be clear with its customers about this kind of information.",0
"I bought this phone in February and it broke today, April 14th. That's exactly one month outside of the return window. Don't waste your money on this!",0
"I absolutely love this phone, it is easy to use and very intuitive. My only disappointment was that the phone came in Chinese, with a Chinese manual, but like I said it is so intuitive to use that I was able to decipher pretty easily how to move around and set it to English within minutes of powering it on. I wish that the description included this information, but it was not a major hassle, just a momentary panic. Love, love, love this...would buy it again!",1
I really didn't want an Iphone then to top it all off the Product was Horrid... It only Worked on Speakerphone... The Home Key Got Stuck.. I was very displeased!!! I wouldn't buy another iPhone to save My life!!!,1
This phone has issues staying connected to Wi-Fi and often says there is no service available. We have tried restarting the phone multiple times without any success. We are now past the return date and are extremely frustrated with how this phone has turned out to be a complete waste.,0
My son wanted to be iphone nation but I had just switched carriers. So I was not going to pay full price for a new phone. Then I said let me look on Amazon.com. this phone did not have scratch on it. Perfect condition. My son loves it. Thank you. Money well spent.,1
"I'm happy with the performance of my phone. I didn't buy a $600 phone so I'm not expecting top of the line technology that those phones bring. This phone does everything I need and meets expectations. The battery really does last a long time and with normal, daily usage I only have to charge about every three days.",1
The phone was working fine at first but then we noticed cracks on the back of the phone . Then one morning i checked my phone and it was not turning on the only thing on the screen.was ios6 i took it to an apple store to see if they could fix the problem but they said it was a used item and there was replaced parts in the phone Along with missing screws. When i purchased the phone the statement said the phone was new thats the only reason why i had ordered it .,1
"My father-in-law was thrilled with this gift! It's a small, simple phone, but he loves it.",0
"Unfortunately, Xenon flash stopped working after 25 clicks, hardware problems with the lock key, I am an unhappy customer.",1
Product was not unlocked so we couldn't use it and had to return it. Very disappointed,1
HTC will always be my favorite phone's brand and this is a great phone!,1
"Poor audio and signal reception. Used with same sim in same location as entry level ""free"" ATT clamshell and the call quality wasnt even close.The radio is a nice touch I guess and it has dual SIM capability so that bumps it up to 2 stars.When you buy a phone like this (not a smartshone) you expect it to do one thing well - make calls. This doesnt.",1
Bought 2 of these one in gold and the other in silver. Neither of these two had reception. We couldn't get any messages or make any calls. I have nearly perfect service at my home and these would never have any bars at my home or while about. Switched the SIM to another phone I had and I got 4 out of 5 bars and everything started working again. Returned these things as soon as I could.,1
"when i got the phone, it looked brand new and clean. It has been a month and no complaints so far, besides the purple/pink tint on the camera",1
ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED‚Ä¶ I RECOMMENDED‚Ä¶ QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL 100% OK‚Ä¶,1
"Got the iphone a little bit early. They said it would be in perfect condition. Well the iphone came and I had to restore it. After I restored it, I tried to play music and one of the speakers doesn't work. The call volume is also very low. nobody can hear me forreal but I can hear them. it'll sound like my fone is breaking up.",1
This is an excellent product and an excellent seller. Everything went well. I'm sorry for the translation.,0
I got an iphone quickly and in good condition. It looks and feels like new and I have had no problems with it yet.,1
The Amazon review says that the service is excellent and very safe. They will continue to use it from Venezuela.,0
"Excelente producto, a pesar de ser usado, esta en muy buenas condiciones tanto est√©ticamente como funcionalmente. El tel√©fono es desbloqueado para todo el mundo.!!",1
"This phone is pretty basic and has a touchscreen. The camera quality is not great, and the website layouts are hard to use and navigate. Also, I ordered a yellow phone but received a black phone instead. I went back to my old phone after two days.",0
Nokia Lumia 1020 is a great phone if you're looking for one that takes amazing photos.,0
This company is shady and will ask for your new device as soon as you start having issues with your current one. Delivery times are always delayed.,0
"I bought this product about three weeks ago and it was well worth the money. It's convenient, stylish, reliable, utilitarian, user friendly and multifunctional. I could never go back to not having a smart phone. Just do it.",1
This item was exactly as advertised and was delivered promptly and securely. I give it 5 stars!,0
"I was looking for an alternative to AT&T's monthly phone payments, and this product seemed like a good option. However, I've had some issues with it- the ringtone is low, it often lags when making calls, and sometimes calls don't go through at all. I'm not sure if I just got a bad phone, but it's been pretty frustrating.",0
"love this phone, worked perfectly in central america, just added a local chip and was able to make and receive calls without any problem.",1
"The phone I got was broken. It wouldn't turn on, and when I took it to a windows store they said it was broken. It would be nice if I was given a new one",1
Phone had a defective camera had to contact Amazon and get my refund and RMA.,1
I'm very satisfied with this phone--it looks good and works properly. I would definitely get another one.,0
Five stars not enough...this deserve endless stars.It's like walking around with a pocket-size computer..Everything I want in a telephone.first class camera and high-class stereo sounds...LOVE THIS PHONE..I REALLY DO..AWESOME PICS AND CRYSTAL-CLEAR VIDEOS..mannnnn I love this phone.,1
"This reviewer is not a fan of Apple, primarily because of the high cost of their products and the way they withhold technology so that later models can include these ""new"" enhancements. However, the reviewer does acknowledge that iPhones have good battery life and a clean interface. They advise anyone with a different carrier to buy a factory unlocked phone to avoid issues. And they say that spending an extra 100+ on a slightly newer product is not worth it - this one works fine.",0
"I was not happy with this purchase. The description said it was factory unlocked and international, but I had to pay an extra $45 to get it unlocked.",0
I love this phone the camera is amazing. Highly Recommend this Phone to anyone who loves to take pictures.,1
"It's a decent phone, but the volume keys have been sticking after just 2 weeks. I don't use them much, so it's not a huge deal, but it's still a bit of a annoyance.",0
"I bought an iPhone 4 32 GB Factory Unlocked, and everything was working well the first day! The product arrived in the mail in 5 days, which is really fast! But while I was sleeping, Voice Control started to turn on and off by itself, and the home button stopped working. I tried to restore it, but the phone keeps going back into recovery mode!",0
Excellent phone for the money! I just got this for my wife as a replacement phone and I have to say we were both blown away by the quality and clarity of the camera and video display. We are on the Metro PCS network and her SIM card from her old phone worked perfectly with no problems in this phone.,1
Good phone. Good Price. You can't go wrong with an HTC One. Or a Samsung Galaxy s4. The next gen phones will be even better.,1
The phone meets my expectations. In particular the camera and the camera related apps are great. Updates to WP 8.1 incl. Cyan (8.12.xxx) were available and automatically downloaded. The WP 8.1 Update update seems not to be available.The only down side is that the phone crashes occasionally and requires a soft reset (I have note been able to identify the reason or a pattern),1
"If you're looking for a good phone at a good price, you can't go wrong with an HTC One or a Samsung Galaxy s4. The next generation of phones is going to be even better.",0
I love this phone. It has exceeded my expectations and the camera is just fantastic!,1
"I give the hardware five stars, especially the camera. The system and apps are not as great, in my opinion.",0
I have used the Iphone 4 for four years now and have had no issues or complaints whatsoever.,0
"Easy to answer,simple to use compared to other operating systems. I traded in LG phone and bought my apple on li",1
I gave this phone to my wife as a present and she loves it - works excellent!,1
"This is exactly the Iphone that I need, especially if I will travel international. I love it.",1
90 day warranty is not worth it. Phone stopped working after less than 60 days. Amazon was no help.,0
There is sound distortion with this headset. The headset doesn't work properly andphoto messages don't download. The phone sometimes rings and sometimes doesn't ring without any change in settings.,0
"I love this phone, but it would be even better if it came with a variety of earbud sizes so that everyone could find a comfortable fit.",0
"I love this phone! The camera is worth it, and the phone runs smoothly. It does lack on apps, but that's not a big deal to me.",0
"My phone froze thin the first couple of days, it's also very inconvenient the way it's set up. The camera is really tricky and inconvenient. The whole camera process takes a lot of time to flip through your reel and get back to taking pictures. It's super frustrating because I want to see a picture and at the touch of a button quickly go back to my camera. This phone takes a long time to load anything. The camera quality is nice but not worth it. Might as well buy a cannon camera.",1
The phone had bumps and ticks all around it when it came and the headphones that came with it were broken and i do not recommend this.,1
"The product arrived in good condition, but the default screen calls choked and reheated when charging the battery. I would have liked to submit a warranty claim, but I'm from Venezuela and it's taking me a while to resolve this problem.",0
"The camera is great and the screen is amazing. It's well-built and reliable, with a good battery that lasts me all day. Some sellers don't include the camera grip as described in the title, so make sure you check with the seller beforehand.",0
"I bought this phone a month ago and it's been good so far. I used to be able to customize my phone a lot more than I can with this one (keyboard, screen, themes, etc.), and I don't like that I can't remove Blinkfeed from the main screen. The phone meets my expectations otherwise, but I'm not sure what will happen down the road.",0
I want to return because is not unlockHow can I do it?Please explain to me.Thank you so much.,1
"I had to bring this phone to Apple after the microphone quit working after just 5 weeks. They gave me a new phone for $150, so I paid a total of $450 for a brand new, factory unlocked 32 GB iPhone 4.",0
100% compatibility with Straight talk / AT&T LTE service. Also has FM radio with tuner so that I can listen to FM stations and not incur data charges.,1
"Received this item as described by the seller, so I am completely satisfied.",0
"I feel so foolish. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia before making my purchase. Like so many others, the home button on my iPhone 4 is locked and the only way I can move from one app to another is to turn the phone off and on again. I'm surprised Amazon is still allowing them to sell through their site.",0
"""I've had the MOST FRUSTRATING experience with this seller in my life. I wouldn't actually leave any stars for them, just had to. This was iPhone 4s box, the bottom of the which was roughly sealed with some dirty paper to cover the real specks, it was blocked and 16 GB instead of 32 GB. Moreover, the seller wouldn't confirm the return of this product despite my 2 emails to them. I do not recommend anyone to do business with this seller ever!!!""",1
This phone is incredible! It's like walking around with a pocket-size computer. Everything I want in a telephone. First-class camera and high-class stereo sounds. I really do love this phone. Awesome pics and crystal-clear videos.,0
"Quick delivery. So far, it's worked like a brand new phone. Perfect condition.",0
"The seller took the product back with no questions asked, so I'll buy a new one next time.",0
"Terrible product. Battery life is weak, keyboard freezes.",1
"The build quality is good, but it doesn't always dial when I call and won't connect while driving. Other than that, it's not a bad phone for the money.",0
"battery was not that good, need to charge twice a day.very narrow screen.",1
I bought this phone for my wife to replace her broken HTC 8X. She likes it better than the HTC. Setup was simple - I took her AT&T SIM from her broken HTC and put it in the Lumina. I turned it on and followed the setup prompts on the screen. She was up and running in about 10 minutes.,0
"I would have given this phone five stars if it weren't for a light scratch on the back cover. Otherwise, it looks almost new.",0
"Phone ended up not working well, a lot of bugs! Buy from your phones carrier!",1
I sent back the iPHONE 4 one month ago because it does not respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back some of the time. I haven't received refund yet. What's going on? Please issue refund as soon as possible. Thank you.,1
"Great phone, few issues with software. tracks just break or don't play. overall great phone.",0
I'm really happy with the product I received from you. It's perfect and I appreciate your good work. Thanks!,0
Parab√©ns!para o loja que vendeu o Apple iphone 4 32GB...esse aparelho √© tudo de bom nos momentos atuais...ele resolve tudo e ti deixa perto dos familiares e amigos...tem coisa melhor?? Se tem nao conhe√ßo mi apresente.Apple estar de PARAB√àNS!!Hoje com o meu apple iphone4 sou a pessoa mais feliz..OBRIGADA.,1
"Love the phone. Very response and intuitive. Camera works very well - crisp, clear. More of a zoom would be nice, but very good nevertheless. Only real drawback - wish there were more apps like for iPhone and Android. This is more a windows issue than a Nokia issue. The apps issue is the only thing keeping me from rating it with 5 stars.",1
" I adore the phone and it arrived rapidly through BREED, affordable price for a top quality phone.",0
"The back of the phone was just blank and (sure, it could have just been replaced as part of the refurb, but...) didn't show the standard Apple logo or product information. A serial number was just printed on a sticker label. Not really willing to trust a thing without a logo or a legitimate serial number, especially if the seller uses a stock photo showing a normal product that does have these identifiers. Disappointed.",0
The stick for the SIM card was missing and the phone can only be used by T-Mobile. Not unlocked guys. But it's still a great phone regardless.,1
"I bought this iPhone as a brand new one, but it turned out to be used. The supplier tricked me :(",0
There is no damages and scratches to this item it is good as new I loved it......,1
"Great phone except one thing, the battery is craps it last only a few hours and even then that is questionable.",1
"Sneaky, asked for a new device sends any user device does not workDelays in delivery time.",1
"After 5 full discharge and 5 full charge, I get just over 48 hours of stand-by time of battery life. According to the specifications I found on line, the stand-by time should be closer to 200 hours. This is the last time I purchase any refurbished product.",1
Frequent crashes! Not reliable with catching available wifi!,1
It's a shame that apple limits some of their amazing products so users have to use methods like jailbrake an unlocking that sometimes limits the usage of the products worldwide.,0
"I cannot use hotspot on my phone simply because it was once at&t, i believe there is a problem with the boot loader which i was not told of, the works well but the screen has some dead cells, i was not told of, i was told it was 9 cosmetic, but it has chipping on two angles, the metal is graved. So much for reburnished, just convinving words, i think poeple should be able to contact the seller before buying.",1
This iPhone is a great replacement for another one. It performs its duties well and is very affordably priced.,0
I love my iPhone! I have traveled all over the world with it and it has worked in every country I have visited. The pictures it takes are amazing.,0
"This phone is great, but the battery drains really quickly.",0
"Day 1 with this phone. I have tmobile and live in the US. Just put my SIM in and it worked right away... Calling, texting, media messanging, WiFi. Great so far. Battery seems to be draining a bit quick, but maybe that's cause I've been using it non stop to set everything up.",1
Was exactly as advertised. Phone works great already rooted with custom bootloader & ROM.,1
"I LOVE MY IPHONE IT WORKS GREATE AND I'M GETTING A NOTHER ONE IN 30 DAYS, FOR MY FRIEND KIM",1
There is distortion in the soundThe head set dose not workThe photo messages don't downloadedSometime ringing and sometimes does not ringing without any Chang in setting,1
I was very pleased with my purchase. Thank you very much. Rafael Gonz√°lez,0
"I was really happy with this phone when I first bought it, but then it stopped charging altogether. I tried to take the back off to see if there was a problem, but it was like it was glued on. So I took it to a radio shack and they said there was a shortage in the phone and I would have to buy a new one.",0
"I love the phone BUT ...... The phone for some strange reason couldn't connect to wifi so I had to take it to the phone store and had them fix the problem , so I had to spend more money üò°",1
"The phone I got was broken. It wouldn't turn on, and when I took it to a windows store they said it was broken. It would be nice if I was given a new one",1
"Amazing Photos just as expected. The Seller - Breed, shipped the item quickly and I received it the day after ordering with the 1 day shipping option which is great since my other phone died. Love the 1020, wish I could find the wireless charging cover somewhere as it seems unavailable, but otherwise I'm very happy with the phone.",1
I couldn't even send this phone back when I first got it the headphones didn't work the charger was broken in the piece that goes in the phone I had to get a new cord meanwhile I was fighting to get my minutes on it after I plugged the new court in all of a sudden the phone shut off it wouldn't go anywhere past the open page the welcome page whatever you want to call it,1

I love my phone the only thing s I can't get pictures messages with metro pcs ... Maybe with T-Mobile I will try soon,1
I bought this product and received it in perfect condition here in Brazil. It works very well and 32GB is a fantastic size for storing pictures and songs.,0
"I sent this phone back because it wouldn't go past the welcome screen. I tried entering language, location, and the beginning of the WiFi router and password, but it would just cycle back to the welcome screen. I thought maybe the phone wasn't fully charged, so I charged it overnight, but it still didn't work. So I sent it back and got a refund.",0
"The iphone was in perfect condition, looked new with all attachments no failure, no scratches, everything was perfect .... many thanks",1
The accessories were not original and the phone got damaged a week after I bought it.The customer service was fine though.,1
I am very disappointed with this phone. It worked fine for about a week then it stopped receiving calls. I returned it to Amazon and received a second phone. This phone lasted for about 3 weeks before it not only stopped receiving calls I frequently had trouble placing calls. Now I am stuck with a phone that is totally useless but Amazon will not let me return because it is a couple of days over the 30 day time limit.,1
"After a few weeks of using this product, I still can't be heard on phone calls by the person I'm talking to. I only use it for texting, even though I'm paying for a service that includes both.",0
The add said it was unlocked And the fact is that I still had to pay extra to someone else to really unlock it and be able to use it,1
The phone is neat and simple to use. The amount of apps is incredible. It is a true personal assistant. My life in full view.,0
It's just okay. The surface is very new. The speed and battery are just okay. I couldn't get it to charge.,0
"Great then. Now it's not so much.Otherwise, great phone as of 2016.",1
"The phones were good; however, the wrong charger was sent and we had to purchase one separately.",0
"Love it , only drawback no Windows 10. It has the best camera out there! The picture and sound is also great.",1
I bought this camera for my teenage daughter who is a photographer. The camera is incredible. I'm going to get a glass screen protector to prevent her from breaking another one!,0
"Too Many scratches on the glass and on the sides, look one in craigslist or pay few more to buy a new one or a different model rather than this used phone. I'm totally disappointed after looking at this phone.I will return and better look for one on craigslist.",1
I returned the phone I bought from AT&T because the earphone portion was defective and I couldn't hear any calls.,0
Came sooner than expected. First one stopped coming on (wouldn't load) after a year. Liked the phone so much bought another one. This one looks and works fine.,1
Received the phone today and it looks brand new so far so good it is in good working order.,1
"Great phone, nokia is a good brand, the phone is reliable, friendly. I had d Nokia N8, really the N8 has more functions (FM transmitter, HDMI output, work as USB Modem), but the camera of 1020 is the big difference. I waiting for the Windows Phone 8.1, because the 8.0 version is not as good one as Symbian Belle.The phone is easy to use, good sound, thanks a god had iTunes integration to copy the music to the phone. For me is 5 stars because I'm a photographer enthusiast.",1
"The product is fine, but the charger doesn't seem to be working properly in Saudi Arabia.",0
"It arrived in excellent condition in Venezuela and was unlocked, just as described on the website. It works with Movistar, Digitel, and Movilnet.",0
Phone arrived on time as promised. This was purchased for my teenager and she LOVES the camera in this phone!,1
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!!! PHONE CAME BETTER THAN I EXSPECTED, PACKAGE BEAUTIFULLY, JUST ALL AROUND AWESOME!!",1
"If Apple allowed users to update their phone past 7.1, I would have kept it. However, now they only provide updates for iPhone 4 users. I say only get this phone if you need a cheap, go-to smartphone.",0
I love my phone! I have taken it all over the world and it has work in every country that I went to and the pictures it takes are WOW.,1
I am very disappointed with this phone. It worked fine for about a week then it stopped receiving calls. I returned it to Amazon and received a second phone. This phone lasted for about 3 weeks before it not only stopped receiving calls I frequently had trouble placing calls. Now I am stuck with a phone that is totally useless but Amazon will not let me return because it is a couple of days over the 30 day time limit.,1
"This iphone 4S 16GB is not good what i was expected. the product have several Problems, like sensor button is not working, there are scratches on front side. and also i didn't receive the ear-hones with my phone., and also when I'm calling the phone got hanged.I'm a loyal customer to Amazon, but i have ever received this kinda product before. very dis-pointed.:(",1

"I've had this product for six weeks and it worked fine, but now the screen isn't displaying part of the top left corner. It's still functional, but it's annoying....",0
"I was disappointed with this phone because the speaker didn't work and the headphones didn't work either. I had to return it, and it was a waste of money.",0
"The iphone is in great conditions as it was told on the details, thank you very happy with my order =]",1
"Good day my phone will not turn HTC one M7 and less than 6 months I have been with the phone in my hands now, I would like to give me some solution to this as soon as possible .",1
I ordered an Samsung Galaxy S4 and they sent me a fake one in a foreign language!,0
"These phones were great and I strongly recommend this customer. I am looking forward to buying more, not sure if there are more in the back stock.",0
"I've bought this phone multiple times and it's great for camera purposes. It takes amazing pictures with the 41 MP camera, especially in low light. The phone's performance overall is also great.",0
The only good thing about this phone is the camera. The bad things include the updates that render the phone full of flaws. You can experience the update to Windows 8 that has the chance to corrupt the rear-facing camera. There is also the chance that the backlight will turn deep blue. Another possibility is that the keyboard will get stuck in Chinese.,0
"I was anxious about buying an iPhone 4 online, so I contacted the seller a few times to ask about the shipment. He was always quick to respond and very patient. I received the phone today and it's perfect. There's no damage and it works perfectly. Thank you for the great experience!",0
"Fast delivery, though one week of use battery not holding charge and now just completely DIED. Didn't come with all accessories as stated and cheap replacement charger. Returning",1
This phone is very important to me. It has everything I wanted in a phone. It has a lot of programs that I love... I really need this phone back. I don't want any other phone but this one. I love this phone.,0
Great Value!!! I will never spend $400 on a phone again.,1
"Excelent product, as always on time to receive the package.",1
phone defective damaged power button and battery back,1
"I purchased this product in the month July 2014 and by January 2015 this product was not working , when I contact amazon response Amazom warrant was only for 3 months but the ditribudor (apple ) Give me warranty for one year . When I went to apple to my surprise the product I buy ""new"" was not new so the house could not do anything",1
"The cellphone wasn't unlocked, that makes it practically unusable for me",1
"Since purchasing this phone it's taken months to get it to work on ATT network. Finally got it to work this week, but ATT tells me the phone is about to expire (dead) because the screen edges are turning yellow! I thought this was supposed to be a decent phone. Can I get a replacement or credit?",1
Great phone. Great price. Even has a good camera.,1
"I was really excited to open my new phone, but then I found out that I couldn't use it because I removed the battery. It's really disappointing that there wasn't any warning about that.",0
"The service is excellent and the conditions are very good. It's a very safe way to do this type of marketing, and I'll continue to use it from Venezuela.",0
"The battery on this phone drains really quickly at first, but after downloading the new OS software, I haven't had any more problems. The condition of the phone is good, as described by the vendor. However, the HTC charger doesn't work. Luckily, I had the same charger from my old, broken phone.",0
If windows had a chat function it would be 5 stars so not really the phones fault.,0
"0 complainsthe iphone came to me brand new....and im using it in Caracas Venezuela, without any trouble!!!!!I think, these models come from europe, cause the battery charger, but these people incorporates an adaptor plug!!!",1
"This is my first Amazon review, and I am very angry. Do not buy this phone! I bought it and it only lasted for 4 months. It's defective - it overheats, doesn't pick up signal well, and the battery drains quickly. Now it won't even turn on. I want my money back! I would give it zero stars if I could.",0
"Outstanding phone... Small, comfortable. Its a perfect basic phone",0
"here in guam , works perfect ,not any problems to activated, , able to work with any sms card and any region, able to download anything , this works fine!! love it",1
"The phone was received quickly and everything worked well except for a rattling noise from the screen when the phone vibrates, possibly due to a loose screen when it was refurbished. But it works perfectly and it's not a big deal.",0
This operating system is easy to use and simpler compared to others. I traded in my LG phone and bought an apple on li.,0
"I received this phone the day after I placed my order. I was very impressed with how quickly it shipped. I am using the phone to write this review and it has been slightly glitchy, but that doesn't bother me because my last phone was much worse. The only problem I have is that it doesn't hold a charge for very long. However, I just purchased a portable charger so I won't have to worry about finding an outlet to charge my phone.",0
Didn't get expected product.Sim slot is Jammed. battery life is bad.took hours to chargekept on restarting after few minutes,1
"This phone looks like new and works perfectly. Just inserted the SIM card from my old phone, went through the easy setup prompts and done!",1
"I've had this phone for about three weeks, and the battery seems to be running out very quickly. Sometimes it suddenly drops from 68% to 0%, and other times it will stay on 1% for hours. I know it was refurbished, but I didn't expect the battery to die so quickly. I'm disappointed, to say the least, and the phone is no longer eligible for return.",0
"It's amazing, my boyfriend also thinks it's really cool... He's always playing with it.. I highly recommend this product, the camera is out of this world!",1
"The microphone on the speaker did not work, and I only realized it later because I don't use the speaker function very often. I have a bluetooth setting in my car. Overall, it's not a big deal, but the product was delivered damaged.",0
"I love the phone, but the back camera doesn't work. Other than that, I'm happy! The price was very reasonable for what I received. Shipping was quick!",0
"my daughter is happy with her new phone, the only thing she does not like about it is the camera. The camera on her iphone 4 was better than this one.",1
HTC will always be my favorite phone's brand and this is a great phone!,1
I am a blue lover. But the screen seem to crack too easy. Need more strength in screen area.,1
"Ir is a decent phone. My only issue is that the volume keys are sticking after 2 weeks, I do not use them much.",1
"llego en excelentes condiciones a venezuela, es liberado, funciona con digitel movistar y movilnet, tal cual lo describian en la paginaarrived in excellent condition Venezuela, is released, works with movistar and movilnet digitel, described it as such on page",1
This is an incredible phone. I can't believe the phone was 32GB and Factory Unlocked and I paid less than a Brand New locked 8GB phone. This is a much better deal and I returned the new iPhone I ordered previously. Thank you so much for this amazing deal. I love Amazon and Bayshine Inc.!!! Heck yeah!,0
"I ordered this phone, thinking it practically new, but it ended up not even being the phone I wanted. It was the iPhone 4 in White, and it had a crack in it. Also, the battery lifespan was no good. I'm using it because I have no other option, but hopefully someone will call the seller out on it next time.",1
Sadly have to return. Finally determined the bottom speaker does not work. Lengthy process to discover. No ring when in my pocket.Otherwise it's a pretty decent small phone (what I was after to begin with).I may try another.....?,1
This worked out great! No visible damage and it works just like before! I'm really happy with the results!,0
"The phone was 8 gigs not 16 and it said good condition it didnt mention the crack on the screen.Phone works good but info was wrongIm happy with the iphone cuz is an iphoneBut if i need to sell it, im going to have to sell itfor $150 less cuz the screen costs $150",1
This phone was unlock. This is very embarrassing for Amazon.com to lie about their products. This is not the firs time.,1
"I received the iPhone i order.The problem is that it doesn't works ok, I am having problems when I call someone from it they don't listen to what I say, I already tread to restore it but it steal doesn't work.The biggest problem aim having is, that I leave I Argentina Buenos Aires and when I go to an Apple store in my country they told me that hear in Argentina they don't have service for IPhone.So I bought an IPhone and I am not able to speak with it.",1
"I received my iPhone quickly and in good condition. It looks and feels like new, and I haven't had any problems with it yet.",0
It was in good condition and worked excellent when I traveled overseas,1
"This phone is great. I had to trade it for another item at one time, but I bought another one because it's very well made.",0
"
I purchased this product because it said that it was unlocked, but it wasn't. Now I am in my country, Ecuador, and it doesn't work, so it is not open to use it worldwide. DON'T BELIEVE THIS PERSON!",0
"The phone worked on arrival but after 3-4 days my daughter noticed that the battery charge did not hold and the phone turned itseld off whenhalf of the battery was discharged. But that is not all. Some days after Wifi stopped working (Wifi button in control center is grayed out).I'm hereby requesting the warranty replacement, but I wouldn't buy another of these ""factory refurbished"" phones from this seller.",1
The phone has functioned as advertised. The beats audio is incredible!,1
"Terrible product!! Would never buy it again!! When the battery is fully drained, it doesn't turn on. Watch a few videos on Youtube, they didn't do the tricks. Battery used very fast and it need to be charge twice a day if the wifi and apps had been running simultaneously. Cameras didn't focus and zoom well. As results, pictures were terrible and unclear. Never recommend to anyone.",1
"I bought it for the camera. I figured with 5 times the resolution of my Apple i4, this phone would be awesome. Not only were the photos horrible, the phone itself sucked! Buy an Apple!",1
"Purchased it for my 16 year old daughter, she did not like the picture quality (future photographer/picky) and just didn't like it overall. It just wasn't for her. Ended up going with BLU Energy which she is loving.",1
"The phone is in great condition and is unlocked, but it is not compatible with all carriers.",0
"The phone was dead when it arrived. It only turned on for a few seconds when plugged in, with the battery at 100%. I returned it the same day.",0
"Amazing Pictures just as expected. The Seller - Breed, shipped the item quickly and I received it the day after ordering with the 1 day shipping option which is great since my other phone died. Love the 1020, wish I could find the wireless charging cover somewhere as it seems unavailable, but otherwise I'm very happy with the phone.",0
Ok.. Bought it for international travel and it is working fine...,1
I was extremely disappointed with this phone. The center button was not working properly and the phone was very slow.,0
Excelente vendedor recomendado al cien porciento. Excelente equipo y excelentes precios recomiendo al 100 % sin mas que agregar. ...,1
"this is used and is in great condition, came with earphone and wall charger and cord. now its the test of putting the sim (micro) {didnt check it would be a problem}in and seeing that it works great. there are very minor scratches on the side but it can be covered by a case.",1
"I absolutely love the phone, the only problem I have is that when I call someone or receive a call the person on the other end can not hear me.",1
great deal. came in original packaging. will buy from again.,1
The deal sounds amazing but the home button is really hard to press to work. The heat plate and screws aren't on the inside so you will have poor wifi connection.,1
Not happy> Bought this as a gift and it will not connect to the internet out side of my house and does not receive picture messages>,1
"This is an excellent phone - it's beautiful and arrived with only a couple of scratches. It's eligible for Straight Talk from Walmart, which is a great deal. There's never a loss of service, making this an excellent buy overall.",0
"What can I say? I previously purchased an iPhone from AT&T. When I found out I had a $200 deductible to replace it, I got this one instead. Great phone. Better price. Same phone.",0
"I bought this phone because of the camera, but it often freezes when recording videos. I ended up returning it.",0
"When I bought this phone, it arrived packaged as new, and it worked and looked fine with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it without any hassle.TL;DR - If you want the original iOS, don't buy this phone.",1
"When someone who doesn't use their Android phone for anything starts using it to stay in touch, that's a good thing.",0
"I have owned this product for less than a month and I am still learning all of its features. I am glad that it runs on Windows, as that is my preferred operating system. So far, I have liked it a lot and have no complaints.",0
"I've been using this phone for a month now and I really like it. The picture quality is amazing ‚Äì much better than my old phone. It's also a bit bigger and heavier, but not enough to be bothersome. There are lots of fun apps and games available, but the main reason I bought this phone was for the camera. So far, it hasn't disappointed.",0
"The phone didn't power on at all. It was defective and I still had to pay to return it, as well as a restocking fee. Terrible.",0
I recommend Universal Cell Services. They have great phones that are easy to use right out of the box.,0
Touch is so off. I can't even factory reset it to send it back.,1
Do not buy this phone!!!My buddy had one and I fell in love with the camera and the microphones and the natural black display but those are THE ONLY good things about this phone. If you like to use apps on your phone (and most people do) do not get this phone. It does not let you get apps from itunes or from google play. you can only use the apps that they've made for it and there aren't that many.,1
"Each day I become more and more satisfied with the Apple iPhone. Amazing performance, incredible graphics, very very functional, a great camera, great touch-screen response, thousand of useful and funny apps, excellent operating system. Apple shows why she's the market leader with this product.",1
"This mobile phone didn't meet my expectations. I experienced problems with charging and other things. I don't think it's original because of these issues. I received the phone today, so I haven't had a chance to use it much yet. I'll be able to tell you more after I've used it a bit, but I'm not satisfied so far. Thanks.",0
"I was disappointed with this product. I thought it would be better than it is. Most of the time, I can't hear anything on the other end when I make a call. Sometimes the whole thing just goes black, even when I have enough battery life. I'm considering returning it for a refund.",0
"This is a great item. I am pleased with the condition as well as the operation of it, however the battery reflects the age of the device. Besides the battery depleting its charge rather quickly I am happy with this phone.",1
The phone was not new as stated it was defected when it arrive also car alarm pruchase did not work cause more than the item too send back,1
"This phone is nice! I received it as described. The battery is the only downside, though.",0
i love this phone the cammera is unspeakably amazing. its no slr but dam close. the lense it has is made by the same manufacturer that is responable for making high end medical optics its responsive light waight and when used with the pd95g cammera grip the battery literaly lasts days on a single charge with heavy usage,1
"There's nothing to say, this phone is everything I've ever wanted and more. The 8.1 update blew me away with every new feature - I was speechless! Cortina made it even better - she met a huge list of things I wanted in a phone before I even realized I wanted it. I'd give more stars but 5 is the max. This is a must-buy!",0
This product is great! The phone is perfect and the seller sent the unlock code as promised. I'm totally satisfied!,0
"I would not recommend this phone to anyone. It looked great at first, but it started having problems within a few months. Now, after only three months, it has completely stopped working and I have to buy a new phone. So, save yourself the time and money and don't buy this phone.",0
"This phone consume a lot of battery power at first, after downloaded the new OS software, I have no more problem with the phone. Good condition as vendor description. The HTC charger does not work. Lucky I have the same charger from my broken phone.",1
"The team arrived well, but I had to pay a high amount to have it unlocked. it did not come unlocked from the factory as the ad said.",0
I bought this cellphone as a gift for my wife. I like it because it is small and easy for her to use. The system is very stable.,0
"The Screen protector began cracking for no apparent reason, and it seems to be cracking more and more.",0
The camera on this phone is slow and you can't access high resolution photos or videos unless you connect the phone to a computer.,0
"The rear camera has a problem where pictures come out with a purple tone when used in an area with little lighting. I found that this is a factory problem with phones produced between March-June 2013. The one sold to me was produced in May 2013, I purchased it on Jan. 2015...I think if they were able to open it to unlock it, they should test the common problems before sending to buyer; I may return it...",1
All I can say is that this is a great product and works propertly. It arrived on time! I am so happy with this purchase.,1
I was very disappointed with this product as the screen froze on me before I had a chance to use it.,0
I purchased this phone from FGSTrading and it is the international version that is factory unlocked. It works well in my country and the most important part of this phone is its stunning looks. Even an iPhone is going to feel shy in front of this beauty. There is no comparison of its screen and sound. This phone has the best screen out there (468 ppi) as well as the boom sound. It feels so good in your hand and gives a royal feeling. The new,0
"No es confiable este proveedor de celulares, debido a que me fue enviado un celular Iphone como nuevo y fue vendido en el ano 2010 a otra persona, o sea era basura. Fui directamente a una tienda apple en Florida porque nunca sirvio y resulto ser que estaba fuera de garantia. Gracias a apple tengo un iphone",1
"
This was our first time ordering a cell phone online. We've always gone into our AT&T store directly. The iPhone is like new. No trouble getting personal contact info transferred and having the phone activated. Only wish we had ordered 2 phones from the same seller. Now I'm on the hunt for another great deal for our second iPhone 4S. I wish I could find more from A&Z. Thank you.",0
"The phone is in great condition and it's an Apple product, so that says a lot about it. I really like my new phone and its new features.",0
"
The battery life is bad. I charged it fully before leaving home. Within a few hours the battery was down to 10%. It was hardly used for 10 minutes of call. This seems unusable. Hope to return the device.",0
"Do not purchase this iPhone. It is used and does not include headphones, the original charger, or the iPhone box.",0
"Love this phone, it's my third one not for the products fault all user errors on my end. Easy to fit in my clutch for nights out, big enough to not slip when I'm texting, glass doesn't crack, can get hot 106 degress from multiple apps use. Loads of storage space- apprei the design feature of the HTC. I did use the remote feature initially and it was simple to set up, now I just find it's as easy to get the real remote. It was novel not necessary. The photo features are enjoyable with the easy of split screen and photo booth functions.",1
"The phone is very good, but the battery drains very quickly.",0
Fast delivery. And so far works like a brand new phone. It came in perfect condition.,1
"I received the device and it appears to be fine. However, I'm not a fan of the design. It seems like if you drop the phone, the front could break easily. I wish the design was better. I would still recommend it to others though.",0
"Good phone, but if you can find a N5 go for that instead. if I bought this for my self I would of returned it becaue all the AT&T crapwear.. You will need to root it to remove all that bloatwareProsAluminum backfastGood StorageCons:full and I mean fulll of AT&T bloatware crap!",1
It's a pretty nice phone only problem it runs hot if u use it for too long that's my only problem,1
"The phone was obviously used, with scratches on the screen. The battery also wasn't able to hold a charge - after just one day it was already at 97%. I returned the phone.",0
"Goodnight, is that the phone you buy is used, but the charger is not HTC, brought no data cable, manual, is not too pleased with the purchase ... not so present in the page amazom for sale .",1
Looks and works great except for the fact that it won't work as a phone but like a iPod instead,1
"I am holding the phone right now, but it took a week to get here. It was supposed to be unlocked, but it is not. I have a Verizon phone, so I am going to try again to get service.",0
"
The phone was new in the box with manufacturer films, totally unlocked, working perfectly. The iPhone is the best phone, no doubts apart from that. The shipment was delivered before the delivery date, and in addition to the phone the seller sent me for free, 2 rubber cases, a set of screen protection and a car charger, they also sent a wall charger. Everything Perfect!! Thank you!",0
"Perfect phone and was in amazing condition, practically like new. The only issue was the low light sensor that happened to be damaged or over heats in my unit, it makes pictures show a purple fade when under low light. But during the day and great lighting the camera is pretty amazing. Battery is also weird but it doesn't really bother me at all since it still lasts me almost all day.",1
I got this phone for my daughter to use on straighttalk. Everything about it is perfect and setting it up on a prepaid plan was alot easier than I expected.,1
"This phone is great! It has a large, color screen, a fast quadcore CPU, and a decent GPU. The camera is really good for such a cheap phone. The only downside is that it only has a small amount of RAM and the front facing camera is not very good.",0
Horrible. Guy scammed me. Could barely hear the person you were talking to.,1
"This phone looks good and feels sturdy and well-built. It has some nice features, but the camera quality isn't great. For the price, it's not bad, but the battery life is good.",0
"Looks and works great, better than Apples' product warranty and support system.",1
"The Apple iPhone is a great product, however it came with no accessories. Not even a charger?! This was disappointing.",0
"Bought it for my wife, no complaints from her. She says way better than old Acer phone",1
Product was not unlocked as statetd! Awful to find out the day before Christmas!!!,1
This item is in excellent condition and looks brand new. I am very pleased with it and will recommend it to my friends. Great product!,0
Product was as advertised and in very good shape. It arrived on time. I think it was an excellent value.,1
It's so bad that something like this could be sold on such a great marketplace.,0
"in the near future you will be in prison if i already contacted the attorney general. just remember that no matter where you try to hide, we can always find you. i hope you're scared of what you're doing because i think you're not believing in bad karma. just remember that bad karma always comes back to you.",0
"Delivered quick and phone had no issues besides the flash does not work, that wasnt stated in the post.",1
"This phone case is missing a key feature--a camera cover. The case is made of leather, so it does offer some protection for the phone.",0
I am very happy with my order and phone. It arrived sooner than they said and is working great!,0
"I love this phone. I think that, besides the functionality, I really like how this sturdy this phone is---with just the right amount of weight to it. If something happens to my phone, I will buy this model again.",1
I had to contact Amazon and get a refund and RMA because the camera on my phone was defective.,0
I would not recommend buying a certified refurbished cell phone. The phone I got was very cheaply made and did not work well.,0
"This iPhone 4s is a great upgrade from the iPhone 3gs. The main features that I love are the 32gb hard drive (allows me to get more apps), the better camera with flash, and the front camera. It makes it fun to take photos. I would highly recommend it.",0
This is an incredible phone and also my first windows phone. i love it! worth every penny spent.,1
I was pleased with the condition of the items and that the description was accurate. The software and hardware seem to be working perfectly. Thanks for a great experience!,0
"No where does it state DO NOT REMOVE BATTERY. When I opened it my battery just fell out, turns out if it is removed it wont even turn on. Piece of crap.",1
"I bought this phone in hopes of something like super great. It's not bad, its actually in really good condition, since I bought it used, but the battery life on this is extremely crappy. If I charge it overnight to 100% and use it again once I wake up, it'll be 85% within 20 minutes of usage. Also, charging this phone is a hassle as well since it takes forever to charge.",1
A 30-minute battery life is not nearly sufficient.,0
"The iPhone is a great phone because it allows you to do anything you want to do. It's like a mini computer, and I love it!",0
"This cell phone provider is not reliable, because I was sent a new iPhone cell phone that was sold in 2010 to another person. I went directly to an Apple store in Florida because it never worked and found out that it was out of warranty. Thanks to Apple, I now have an iPhone.",0
This product has a short battery life and requires daily charging.,0
"Phone is good, but the charger has wired buzzing sound once plugged in. I ended up using a different charger that I have around the house. I bought it for my daughter, she really does not need a smart phone to distract her, so this simple one should do the job for calling and texting.",1
The phone died couple months later. The screen is all black. Not very happy with this purchase.,1
"I received the phone today and it looks brand new. So far, so good. It is in good working order.",0

"Great phone, always been a Nokia fan, love the picture quality",1
"I bought this phone on October 18, 2015, but I can't get any network reception on it. That means I can't make regular calls with it. I tried to find some answers on HTC's support page, but the phone isn't even listed there.",0
This phone has a short battery life. I am constantly recharging. The phone takes too long to power up. I am strongly considering selling it and getting another brand.,0
"thank you so much , as expected the phone come with the camera grip as describedreally good mobile with very powerful camera big thanks to Nokia and Microsoft and the lovely seller",1
"I figured out why this phone was so cheap - it doesn't work. We got it out of the box and it looked fine. Took it to ATT to have the old phone transferred to the new. After all that there was ""no service"". AT&T further inspected to find that the hardware is faulty. That sucks!",0
The battery does not stay charged long enough . In the phone The phone gets hot all the time,1
"The phone looks pretty good, it works properly, I love it and I would probably get another one, I am very satisfied",1
"I ordered this phone on a Saturday, and it arrived at my door on Tuesday via FedEx. The shipping estimate on Amazon's website said it would take 45+ days for the phone to arrive, so I was very happy to get it in just 4 days. The phone looked brand new, and all the accessories were in the box. Life is good!",0
"I am very angry.This phone is not Refurbished phone.The iphone's back has many hairline scratchesand Battery life is very short. Is only one-fifth of the normal.Setup iOS version is 9.0, so iphone speed is very slow.OMG purchase.",1
I got an amazing phone with almost 50% off! They even gave me options to choose different colors. And they gave 1 year warranty. Good job! Thank you.,0
"This phone looks as good as new and works flawlessly. Just inserted the SIM card from my old phone, went through the quick setup prompts and that was it!",0
I had to get this phone 2 times. First it was the battery sent it back got another then the phone was not unlocked. Don't waste your money on this.,1
My daughter loves her new iPhone. I just bought an AT&T sims card and works great.,1
"I would recommend this phone to anyone. I had it for less than a year and it started having issues. I got it flashed so it could work on another network, but after a few months people would call me and I could hear them but they couldn't hear me. I took it to an iPhone repair shop and they replaced the microphone, but it still didn't work. I switched to another phone.",0
I have been unable to update my phone automatically or manually.. finally had to take it to a technician who informed me that the boot loader had been tampered with..its been one headache since then..if there was a negative one star I would give it to this seller,0
"Bought two of them. The first one you have to push the middle button a few times to get it to work. The second one was ok, but the volume seems to mess up on it a lot.",1
"I bought this phone in hopes of something like super great. It's not bad, its actually in really good condition, since I bought it used, but the battery life on this is extremely crappy. If I charge it overnight to 100% and use it again once I wake up, it'll be 85% within 20 minutes of usage. Also, charging this phone is a hassle as well since it takes forever to charge.",1
Just to remember Nokia and find a machine to develop Windows Phone software.,0
Excellent dealer. I am very satisfied with my Nokia. Thans a lot.,1
"buy 2 , one would run a few weeks the wifi and then stopped when I wanted to make a claim had already spent time replacement",1
"The iphone 4 shipped quickly and came with all accessories in the original packaging. The phone looked almost brand new but the home button did not always register. Ive heard that this issue is not that uncommon because lint and dust get trapped under the button. This was however a $315 phone listed as ""like new"" so I expected it to work flawlessly. This is my first amazon return but the process has been pretty easy so far.",0
Pretty phone but doesn't have good reception. To much trouble to make and receive calls,1
"I bought a brand-new one of these, as opposed to the refurbished ones and I am sending it back today. It worked for maybe two weeks and then it just stopped working. I couldn't open it up, so I took it to the Apple store and they said it was defective and there is nothing I can do. Since it doesn't have a warranty, they would give me another one for $143.00, if I wanted. I am really disappointed and now I",0
The mobile phone is not working as expected. The middle button is not working properly and the phone is overall too slow.,0
Outstanding performance; easy to use. Speed and sound beyond expectations for the price. Great with my PChero bluetooth too. Highly recommend for the price. Beats other more expensive smartphones I've had.,1

"I'm very satisfied with this item. It's exactly as described, and I was surprised to receive it even on Christmas holidays. Full points to me!!!",0
90 days is not enough time for this product. It died and was a waste of money. I am very disappointed.,0
Son loves it I got it for him as a Christmas gift and he's very happy and the phone is still running strong! Love this thing!,1
"After using the phone for a couple of days, I started noticing that it would randomly turn off and then wouldn't turn back on.",0
Great phone. Came before was expected Good pictures,1
"My son's first smart phone and he loves it! It was in excellent condition when it arrived. For the price we paid and the condition it was in, we consider it a steal!",0
"The phone camera is great and the phone automatically updated to WP 8.1. The only downside is that the phone crashes occasionally, but I have not been able to figure out why.",0
"It completely failed. When I inserted the new SIM card, it did not work. I had specifically asked for an unblocked phone that I could use during my trip to Tabzania,and I had to buy a phone there instead. A total waste of money.",1
The phone was great and as it said in the decription I loved it and it did really save me a trip to the store!!!!!!,1
"This is a used phone, but it's in great condition. It came with earphones and a wall charger and cord. Now we'll see if it works great with a SIM card. There are very minor scratches on the side, but they can be covered with a case.",0
"I have never written a review for any product I have purchased before. I am making an exception here because Mr. Kyle Wunderli, of Better Deals FASTER is an outstanding businessman with very high quality products, extremely fast delivery time, and superb customer skills. Although I paid a little more from this seller than from another, I would purchase from this seller again!",0
The phone's built-in TV tuner is very basic and doesn't work well. You'll be lucky if you can even find one watchable channel.,0
The phone's OS is not very good and there has not been a new update. But the camera is good.,0
failed to provide the complete 16 digit # on the paperwork,1
I should of listened to everyone else that said the battery is terrible. It dies within an hour after a full charge.,1
I'm glad I upgraded from my 3GS to this phone. It's wonderful!,0
Xenon flash is broken and battery last 8 hours.,1
"the best ever! i broke it, and I'm going to bought the same! recomended!",1
"Gave this to granddaughter...It,s to smart for anyone to figure out.She can run it fine",1
"I decided to get a smartphone for work purposes, and Amazon had the best prices and guarantees. I'm very happy with the phone I got, which was in great condition.",0
"Very nice phone. Seller did not seem to know much about the phone, though.",1
"You can't go wrong with an Apple product. The iPhone is very convenient, easy to use, and works great. It has everything you need in a phone, from a personal planner to entertainment and anything else you can think of.",0
This product is not great. The TV doesn't work and the pictures and videos come out poorly. I don't really care one way or the other.,0
I bought one from aucee .. and not even two week it's broke . The screen is turn off . Before that happened the touch screen on one spot is not working and then the battery never last a day with fully charged.,1
THIS WILL NOT WORK WITH SIMPLE MOBILE PREPAID CARRIER. ITS LOCKED PHONE AND PROBLEM TO UNLOCKED. I RETURNED THIS PEACE OF CRAP,1
"I am very happy with my purchase of this phone. It arrived just as described, except for the fact that the home button is sticking. Aside from that small issue, I am very pleased with the product.",0
It seems like you're having trouble updating your phone's software. Can you tell me more about the issue you're experiencing?,0
"I had to return it, because it would not work with Tracfone. It did not have cdma protocol required by Tracfone. The phone itself was in perfect condition, and I hated to part with it.",1
We ordered this factory refurbished phone! We missed the return date otherwise we would have returned it! It really never worked properly! We will never buy a refurbished phone again! It is a scam!,1
My brother used the phone after I sent it to Vietnam and discovered that the charger and speaker didn't work - the phone was broken.,0
"Good phone, few issues with software. songs just break or dont play. overall good phone",1
"It's wonderful. it can run quickly, has a beautiful screen, takes good pictures and light enough. But windows phones don't have enough choices for app, some of them cost money. All in all, it's a great phone.",1
"This product was terrible and not at all what I expected from a ""refurbished"" item. The battery was bad, the charging dock didn't work, and the microphone was terrible. Amazon was great about issuing a refund, though, and I thank them for their amazing customer service.",0
"OK..Did not come with SIM card slot pin.Did not come with ""includes all original accessories"" as stated in the product description.The included charger is cheaply made.Has some scratches.",1
"This phone is great. It has all the features I need, plus more. I hope to find a better model at a good price so I can upgrade.",0
I just ordered this product and the sound doesn't seem to be working properly. I can barely hear the person I'm speaking to when the volume is turned up all the way!,0
"The piece that I received was not a ""used"" one as they said, it was a ""refurbished"" one. I was not at all satisfied with the product and returned it back.",0
I was really happy with my purchase of a factory refurbished phone. It was just like a brand new phone and I couldn't be happier with it.,0
the iphone came with the power/ sleep button bad so i had to paid 6$ to fix it and also the charger came wrong is ther charger of iphone 5s,1
"It is a good phone, easy to use and simple. It works so good in Venezuela with carrier movilnet. Well done blu.",1
"
I've had the phone for a few months now and it's still working pretty well.",0

"Phone dead on arrival. Only turning on for few seconds when plugged in, with battery at 100% change. Returned same day.",1
The phone that was delivered did not even last 24 Hours. Later I read a lot of reviews of HTC one M7 having this problem of crashing and then not turning on . Currently waiting for the replacement. But not at all satisfied both with HTC M7 model and the seller who is selling it in Amazon.,1
I give it 5 stars because its my first i phone 4 ever so all nice features keep it up apple company :),1
"Love the phone. Other than two small problems, nothing to complain about: 1) The camera has a difficult time taking photos of text, even in text mode. 2) There is a limited selection of apps, which was surprising coming from an Android platform.",1
Thank you so much! The phone comes with the camera grip as described. Really good mobile with a very powerful camera. Big thanks to Nokia and Microsoft! The lovely seller is great!,0
I am happy with this phone. It does everything I wanted it to do. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you.,0
"Tends to have problem with the battery due to is a Refurbish phone, but it works perfectly",1
"The phone was defective, but the customer service was great and they fixed the issue.",0
"I am very happy with my phone. It actually came 2 days earlier than scheduled. It was in excellent working condition. I read a bunch of reviews before I ordered it. I was worried about buying used electronics. Something I never do. But, I'm glad I did. I saved alot of money and That's always a plus!",1
The iphone broke the first day i used it. nothing of the phone was apple original.The iphone was in really bad conditions,1
"The phone randomly shuts itself off, even when the battery isn't dead. The battery drains in less than two days, even with NO use! It was supposed to be new in the box, but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.",0
"Used iPhone in excellent condition. Backlight bleed through the headphone jack and sim card tray, but still has applecare. so doesn't matter.",0
Very powerful phone. Big change for an Android user.,1
I bought this for international travel and it seems to be working fine.,0
"Horrible device, Keeps freezing, keeps resetting, activated the narrator and phone refuses to do anything. Great camera but all in all this phone isn't worth it. Nokia messed up on this one.",1
i boutght two of this... one came in OK condition... The other one comes with scratches and with a battery that wont last 1 hour... i am very dissapointed.,1
"This phone didn't last 2 months. When I checked to view the return policy, it was only for 30 days. That's not fair. The speaker isn't working and the phone shuts down unexpectedly. I believe this phone was never a new phone!. Buyers beware!",1
The phone is cool and easy to use. The number of apps is amazing. It is a real personal assistant. My life in full view.,1
I ordered for Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked)- refurbished. The piece looks good to see. But the home is not functioning. I am totally disappointed with the seller. I dont know what to do now.,1
"The piece that I received was not a refurbished as they said, it was a used one. I was not at all satisfied with the product and returned it back.",1
This is an outstanding phone! It's easy to use and the performance is amazing. The speed and sound quality are beyond what I expected for the price. It's also great with my PChero bluetooth. I highly recommend this phone - it's even better than some of the more expensive smartphones I've had.,0
This budget-friendly phone is perfect for those who need a dual sim phone that works globally. My uncle used it during his trip to South America and had no issues. The phone even has a radio!,0
"In less than 2 months, phone got stuck on earphones mode. I must have used the earphones twice max. So one cannot hear anything unless an earphone is plugged. Item can no longer be returned nor exchanged. Pathetic that a wanna be flagship phone has such cheap quality. Never again Nokia nor Microsoft",1
I use the camera a lot but it crashes quite often so i have to reset it.,1
Phone as arrived better condition than description. Happy :),1
"I have had trouble with my calls not going through, my friends not getting my texts, and my phone taking a long time to start dialing when I try to make a call. I went back to my old phone and it worked just fine, so it's not the service.",0
"I was satisfied with the product, it functions as advertised. I have it for Straight Talk, it was a pretty good deal I thought. The only reason I give it four stars is due to the one hundred dollar price decrease it received almost immediately after I purchased the device. But other than that, it's a very good phone. But, if I were to do it over, I would be looking into the Nexus 5 or 6. But overall, no real complaints!",0
We ordered a white phone and received a black one instead. Both the original and replacement orders were incorrect.,0
"I love this phone, but if you can tell me how to fix the problem it has and it spent upgrade to lollipop I'll rate 5 stars",1
"
I really like my phone. It looks expensive, which it is. I didn't know it was a HTC one7. I didn't pay attention to it when I was ordering it. I was just looking at the picture of the phone and got excited and ordered it right away because the price was a little down. I wanted the HTC one 8, so I'm going to keep the phone for a year and then probably the end of the year I will get the one I really want.",0
"My son had cracked his 3GS and some other things were not working well, so I bought this phone to replace his 3GS. He doesn't need Siri and some of the other features of the 4GS and 5, so I was ecstatic to find this new, unused iPhone 4 to replace his 3GS. The phone seems to be fine and set up was easy as we restored it from a back up of his 3GS and then he updated the operating system. I was worried purchasing it this way, but so far, so good!!!",1
"This phone is very smooth and easy to operator. Love product, price was great!",1
iphone 4 was the most classic phone as jobs said,0
Worked for a few weeks then went out can't be repaired. A hardware issue. Had to replace it.,1
"Hi there, my user is velis33@gmail.com. I made a purchase of a 32GB iPhone 4 on February 15, 2014 and I was wondering if I was already supposed to have received it by now. I'm getting impatient waiting.",0
"Cheap Phone, Cheap quality, No Volume settings, Cannot read the files from SD, No ringtone Option. Menu is Sucks, Cannot transfer data from SD to phone, Only reads mp3 files from SD card via File manager. Waste of Money. Do not buy it!!!! Add some more cash and get something better!!!! Even 10 years old qwerty cellphones have more functions than this one!!!!",1
"I absolutely love this phone! It's fast and doesn't lag, and the yellow is really pretty. I bought it used, but it came in great shape with the USB chords and instruction book. The only downside is that it didn't come with a SIM key, but that doesn't matter because the camera is amazing.",0
Great delivery! Got it within 2 days and I bought it over the weekend. Phone works perfectly.,0
We receive without all the accessories and the charge doesn`t complete. You are selling a bad product.,1
"This phone is pretty, but its reception isn't great. Making and receiving calls is too much trouble.",0
"Had this phone for 3 days, crashed 3 times, took 5 minutes and more to get it to turn back on.",1
"Its affortable and there was nothing wrong with it at all; no damage, no scratches, nothing. A great buy. Thank you",1
"The phone was in excellent condition and looked brand new, but it wasn't a Verizon phone as advertised on Amazon.",0
"The camera is great, and works beautifully with Nokia photo apps.Everything is running smoothly and never had any system break until now.Windows phone is really limited. Too little apps and too little developers.They could work better on the usability and inteligence of the system too.Lumia 1020 heats pretty easily.The camera grid is very nice to save battery or to save a great pic when the battery is running low, eventhough it makes your phone look like a brick.",1
But you better press the hang-up button twice or you are gonna be paying for minutes.,1
Love it now that my work mates can text me for any shift changes or new shift been added into work schedule,1
It is too hot if owner talk or using Tango or Viber for chats for about 30 minutes.,1
Best Camera ever.....o(^-^)o Will there be a camera higher then 41MP? For now get this one you will love it....^_^,1
Still a great phone. You can't get a mid tier phone that's new with the same quality for the price.The only problem was that The Wireless Circle sold me a used phone that was supposed to be new. It was obvious because there was a screen protector installed by a previous owner. I returned it and purchased a One through WCE and it was actually new. Inspect it closely because you don't want a 2 year old phone that's possibly been used.,1
"Replacement for another 1020. Disappointed that the phone didn't come with the advertised wrist strap, so I'm using my old one. By the way, I'm using this ATT phone on T-Mobile. Everything works well except tethering (Internet Sharing). I keep my old HTC around and switch SIM cards when I need to tether, which can be a hassle. If you need to use your phone as a WiFi hotspot then avoid this one because it won't work.",0
"I should have known why this phone was so cheap - it doesn't work. We got it out of the box and it looked fine. Took it to ATT to have the old phone transferred to the new. After all that there was ""no service"". AT&T further inspected to find that the hardware is faulty. Great!",1
"My iphone 4 arrived in excellent cosmetic condition. It was working fine functionally. But as time passed, I realized that the camera is not that good as it is suppose to be. Also, the home button became sticky after 1 month. I had to press it multiple times to get it to work.I have given it a 3 stars because of its features for the price that I got it for - $360.",1
"The condition of the phone was amazing, practically like new. The only issue was the low light sensor that was either damaged or overheating in my unit, which made pictures taken in low light show a purple tint. However, during the day and in great lighting, the camera was pretty amazing. The battery was also weird, but it didn't bother me at all since it still lasted me almost the entire day.",0
The item was exactly as advertised and was delivered promptly and securely. I give it 5 stars!,0
"This is a good option if you don't want to get a new contract. The phone is in great condition, with no scratches, and it comes with the charger cord.",0
I ordered an unlocked 1020 Nokia lumina but I was sent a locked phone instead of the one I ordered. I feel so bad that I don't think I will return to your site again for any purchase.,1
This phone has been working great for me for a few months now. I'm writing this review to let you know that it's definitely worth the purchase.,0
"sometimes the sound on videos , music & keyboard clicks are just loud static & it won't turn down , not worth more than $100 IF THAT ...",1
great phone works amazing and the camera is wow.,1
"Day 1 with this phone. I have tmobile and live in the US. Just put my SIM in and it worked right away... Calling, texting, media messanging, WiFi. Great so far. Battery seems to be draining a bit quick, but maybe that's cause I've been using it non stop to set everything up.",1
"I bought this phone because I was told it would be unlocked and work worldwide. Unfortunately, the phone only works with 2G in my country (Argentina). So if you're thinking of buying one for use in a foreign country, you might want to think twice.",0
"the device shap looked good but i have problem with the home key... it was bad, otherwise it was good",1
"The camera is not very good in low light and is slow to focus. There are also problems with the internal microphones, with the secondary one no longer working. There are also issues with the charging port. After a repair, the camera was not recognized by any computer and had to be sent for repair again. However, the photos taken with the camera are very good quality.",0
"After a week of using the chat feature, I began to experience glitches where others couldn't hear me on the line. Additionally, the chat feature has become slow and bogged down with problems.",0
"this worked great, it started out as a glorified iPod then to my iPhone. No issues with it. worked like a charm",1
great phone works amazing and the camera is wow.,1
Phone wasn't unlocked. Numerous techs from AT&T couldn't get it functioning properly. Powered up but couldn't make or receive calls.,1
"I bought this iPhone from the Amazon Warehouse, and when I opened it, it looked brand new. The only thing to complain about is the home button, but that's not even a big deal. It did take a long time to ship, and UPS is truly the most crappy delivery company I've ever had to deal with. But other than that, I'm very happy with this purchase.",0
"DON'T BUY, I RECEIVED AN AWFUL IMITATION, NOT AN ORIGINAL NOKIA PRODUCT",1
Device has issue with charging once it is completely drained.,0
"Great phone. Had to trade it for another item at one time and bought another one, very well made phone",1
"I'm not satisfied with this product. It doesn't meet my expectations. The screen scrambles during phone calls, and sometimes I can't answer incoming calls because the ""slide to unlock"" feature doesn't work.",0
For a used phone I thought that it was in very good condition. My only gripe is that my simple mobile sim card is incompatible. Other than that I'm satisfied with it.,1
"The product looks great and is easy to use and update the software. However, you need to be careful about how you hold it, or else you will reduce the strength of the signal.",0
"If you love high quality compact camera's and don't want to carry that and a GREAT phone all in one pocket, THIS IS THE PRODUCT! I do not regret getting it one bit. It's fantastic!",1
"PIECE OF S*** PHONE! I waited 6 months to activate - switched to Verizon from T-Mobile after 15 years of service - and the phone will NOT work NO signal... REALLY!? I have 4 young sons that I need to keep in contact with at all time! Doctors, hospitals, appointments! If I could cram this phone up someone's ASS I would!",1
"This phone arrived in excellent condition in Venezuela. It is unlocked and works with Movistar, Digitel, and Movilnet, just as described on the website.",0
It was easy to transfer all info from my old phone. This one works great and meets my needs.,0
"This phone is a scam. It doesn't work most of the time, and when I called customer service, they said they wouldn't replace it. Save your money and don't buy this phone.",0
Love the battery life..the only reason i deal with the smaller screen. Usually get Blu Dash 5.5,1
"I did not get headphone with this item and because of other reasons too i returned this phone, and i got back full amount. I am happy that i got my money back.",1
I was very disappointed with this purchase - I couldn't use it for the internet at all. I took it to the local phone store and they said it was useless. I won't make that mistake again.,0
"I was happy with the quality of the equipment and it arrived as described. The delivery was a day late, but I'm not complaining. I would definitely recommend this product.",0
Good phone. Good Price. You can't go wrong with an HTC One. Or a Samsung Galaxy s4. The next gen phones will be even better.,1
"I bought this phone a month ago and it started doing weird things almost immediately. I've never dropped it and it's always been in a hardcore case, but it will only make calls when it can get a signal. It's been aweful; the buttons work sometimes and sometimes they don't, and sometimes they work on their own. It rarely has a signal, even when I'm logged in to my wifi and standing right next to it. This is the worst phone I have ever",0
"Love it. It has lots of different language including Chinese. I can type in Chinese too. Very light, got them on time. I have had time to open the cover and hard time to insert SIM Card. It will be better to inform us how to open the cover and insert the SIM Card. The cover is one piece. in order to insert the SIM card, you need to force the SIM Card cover inside the phone to unlock first. You can put two phone cards in.",1
I bought and received in perfect conditions here in Brazil.It works very well and 32GB is a fantastic size to put pictures and songs...,1
"This phone died on 3-30-2016, that means it lived for approx 4 months only!! I tried to return it...couldn't. I spent over a hundred dollars for this phone that lasted for only 4 months. Absolutely unacceptable!!",1
I am very pleased with the product. It arrived exactly as described and in great condition. It was a 16th birthday present for my daughter and has held up well so far. Thank you!,0
Phone was NOT unlocked as stated! It was Verizon contract phone! Buyer beware!,1
This phone is great! It's a great price and the service is fast.,0
"This is a really good phone, but it shouldn't take nearly two months to deliver.",0
the phone did not last for even two weeks before it developed a fault,1
"I bought this phone mainly because of the camera. Phone is nice. Feels better than my old i phone 4s or the samsung S3. But have to take time to get used to the windows system. It's not that simple to use as I phone. And there are very few good Apps to download. And I hate the earphone. It never stays on, drop off easily. I really hate it. I use my old iphone's earbud instead, thought it can not control this phone's volume or on/off. And this is IMPORTANT: Make sure you buy from the right seller! I got one that's not new from another seller and had to return and then got this one from "" Chubbiestech "".",1
"I feel really stupid for not reading all the reviews about Wireovia before buying this iPhone. Like so many others, the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I'm surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site.",0
"The button on the bottom of the phone is very hard to press, and I had to call the company to find out what to do. They said I could either send the phone back, or they would refund me $35 out of the $289 I paid. I chose to get a refund because it would have cost me at least $64 to fix the phone.",0
"I love my iPhone. It works great, and I'm getting another one in 30 days for my friend Kim.",0
I have an HTC one M7 that is less than 6 months old and it will not turn on. I would appreciate if someone could provide a solution to this problem as soon as possible.,0
"This was a gift for my wife and she is happy with it but. Everything works fine except for wi-fi, that is greyed out and not usable. Just google wi-fi issues on iPhone 4s and you will see what I mean. You make your own mind on this one",1
"The item was delivered when it was supposed to be and in a very good packaging. The item is excellent, as I expected to be. Thank you very much!",1
"I found this phone to be slow and prone to freezing. Reception was also very poor. 3G was the only network option available, so I returned it and went back to my Android phone.",0
"This was better than described, phone is like new, with barely visible scratches, no dents or serious damage, came with all accessories even when it did say that it only included was the phone",1
"The phone was in excellent condition just as stated..works wonderful..I'd recommend the iPhone 4 to anyway, it's great, love all I can do",1
The phone have a problem with the earphone to listen to people when you call.,1
"All things a go! I love it, it's just what I expected. Thanks! I upgraded from iPhone 3 to iPhone 4s. The iPhone 4s is way more advanced then my iPhone 3. I feel like I've moved up in technology phase. Can't wait to advance to the iPhone 5 or even the iPhone 6s.üëçüèΩüì±üì≤",1
"I bought because It said that It was unlocked but It wasn't. Now I am in my country, Ecuador and It doesn't work so it is not open to use it worldwide.DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY !",1
"You can't go wrong with this phone. It's a great value for the price and the quality is still top notch. Just be careful if you're buying it used, as there's a chance you could end up with a phone that's 2 years old.",0
"The phone arrived in perfect condition, as promised. It was unlocked, so I could use it with straight talk, which I am very happy about.",0
"I bought this phone on August 27th, and it stopped working on October 11th. I couldn't even charge it. I contacted CV and they reset the phone remotely. Thank you.",0
"Excelente producto, a pesar de ser usado, esta en muy buenas condiciones tanto est√©ticamente como funcionalmente. El tel√©fono es desbloqueado para todo el mundo.!!",1
" ghastly phone, even after update, its in a perpetual state of reset. I have $100 phones that work way better. I urge you to keep away from this brand and operating system.",0
"The phone has plenty of storage for preteen selfies, but the camera is just average.",0
"This phone is broken and full of hardware problems. It keeps turning off automatically, and even soft and hard resets don't work. I'm returning it today and hoping the company will send me a working one.",0
Do Not BUY!!!NOT UNLOCKED. Why would Amazon even put up with this?,1
"Great Buy, arrived in very good Condition with charger, set it up in Minutes üòçüòçüòçüòçüëçüëçüëçüëçMade my 10 years old daughter Happy!",1
"I needed a new phone to replace a ruined one and this phone had all the features of my old phone, or more. The price was right for a phone with all these features!",0
I am so pleased with this purchase! Phone is in excellent condition as described and shipping was fast! This was one of the best purchases i've made and I'm so glad it was with bestDeals!! Thank you so much....absolutely no regrets and I will continue to buy merchandise from them!,1
"
This product has a few different models. The one I have is model 801e (M7_U), made in Taiwan. It's the Asian version, and I confirmed this information with HTC support and a number of other forums. It does NOT have LTE/4G support! When I discovered the problem, I contacted the seller, who did nothing and said it was too late to reclaim. Seriously, you don't know anything about the product and you still sold it. Don't",0
"As of today, I still DO NOT have it working with StraightTalk. I am NOT happy. This is the third time!!! We have had to get a different SIM card and still no luck.",0
"Good Iphone I have no comments for the product, may be I had check for another one for me but Iphone five unlocked.",1
"Bought these phones for my brothers; received them in a very timely manner. No scratches, phones worked great! I definitely recommend purchasing from this user.",1
The iphone broke the first day i used it. nothing of the phone was apple original.The iphone was in really bad conditions,1
"I was impressed with how new and clean the phone looked when I received it. It's been a month now and I haven't had any issues, except for the purple/pink tint on the camera.",0
"- Works with Straight Talk.- LTE, 4G, 3G, etc all work just fine.- Ships with windows 8.0- Can be updated to 8.1 for free.- Cortana personal assistant is part of 8.1I use the Straight Talk AT&T sim card, and it works great. There seems to be confusion regarding the network compatibility- but it works flawlessly with AT&T sim. The device comes with windows 8.0, and can be updated",0
Great deliviry! Got it within 2 days and I bought it over the weekend. Phone works perfectly,1
Very good phone. I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone interested.,0
"I really love this phone. It's got a great touchscreen and it's very affordable. At first it kept restarting automatically, but after I updated all the apps it works great. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who needs a high-quality smartphone on a budget.",0
Please don't buy this it's older I think one of the first HTC I haven't been able to update that's been going on for days many other flaws get a newer model HTC 7 or 8 I'm going to,1
"The phone itself was great. Until it broke (buttons stopped working) after 3 months. Then I discovered that it was out of warranty, because it was NOT new as stated.This was a ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" seller. It doesn't matter. They are no better than every other seller out there lying about their merchandise. And all Amazon can do is issue a refund.",1
"I bought this phone because it was advertised as being unlocked, but it wasn't. Now I'm in my home country of Ecuador and it doesn't work, so it's not open to use worldwide. DON'T BELIEVE THIS GUY!",0
Great Cell phone and easy to use great photos. Compatible with almost all Windows applications. I recommended better than Android.,1
"This item is in great condition and works perfectly. I highly recommend this seller, as they provided fast delivery.",0
"Overall the quality of the phone is amazing for the price. The screen is very Hd, everything is running smoothly. Would give it five stars but the screen protector it came with did not fit so that was disappointing.",1
This phone is beautiful and has the best smartphone camera available. I've been using Windows Phone for over 3 years and I'm happy with it.,0
I received this phone and it is only unlocked to AT&T. It is not completely unlocked.,0
"It's a strong 2. I got it primarily for the camera, which works very well. Windows really sucks compared to Android; it's too bad they can't put out a product like Android.",0
"good afternoon my user is velis33@gmail.com I make a purchase of a 32GB iPhone 4 used the day February 15, 2014, I wonder if I'm already happened with the team why not come ah me anything yet and I waiting time",1
"I can't give this product a good rating. I'm seeing two videos and four pictures on the phone, and I'm not sure if it's been used. It looks like it might have been taken by accident during packaging, but I can't be sure. I'm not happy with this purchase.",0
"Do not buy from this dealer. They are fraudulent and will try to sell you old phones as new. I bought an iPhone 4 from them for $150, only to find out that it was 3 years old, needed a new battery, and had a defective microphone. I had to replace it with a new iPhone 4 from Apple, which cost me an additional $150. You can check the history of a phone with its serial number through Apple.",0
"This unit had guaranteed recertification, but the Wi-Fi didn't work and the battery wouldn't hold a charge.",0
I received the IPhone 4 and found that the microphone doesn't work; I spent a lot of money for a paperweight. I want my money back.,0
Not happy at all... I bought this phone that is Supposed to be unlocked But it's not at all. So know I have to figure out how to unlock it since it's my daughter birthday gift that she can't even use now...grrr,1
"I bought this phone for my mom. She wanted something simple, and this did the trick. The buttons are big and very visible, and she likes it.",0
"I just bought it (March 4, 2015) and the touch screen is not working anymore! I receive the phone calls but I can't answer them or anything. It happend less than 3 months after purchasing it! It's unbelieveble!",1
"Almost brand new, it has a really small bump easy to miss. Great phone, complete with cables, deliver on time. Thanks!",1
The unlocked iPhone is great for international use. I bought it for a two-year assignment in Brazil and it worked well - I never had any problems.,0
Please don't buy this it's older I think one of the first HTC I haven't been able to update that's been going on for days many other flaws get a newer model HTC 7 or 8 I'm going to,1
"I wasn't able to afford a galaxy s3 or 4 or iPhone yet. I was so happy to see this deal. The used phone was pretty much new, no scratches working properly. The shipping was fast I just connected with AIO(great plan they have by the way). I am very satisfied. I haven't had no issues with amazon yet anyway. Love love the phone",1
"We received the phone and charged it, but it died while my husband was out. We charged it again when he came home, but it continued to turn off and on repeatedly. A factory reset didn't fix the problem, so we sent it back for a refund and ordered from another seller. They refunded us in a timely manner, but the little key to open the Sim Card slot was missing.",0
"camera came in 2 days,brand new and sparkly,just transferred my sim card and voila--thank you!",1
"This is an iPhone with Siri, and I love her! I switched my old, crappy LG 90 phone to this one simply by inserting my SIM card and transferring my data using the Copy My Data app. Why would you spend more than $80 on a phone when this one works great and does everything you need? I'm laughing at my friends who paid $700 for their iPhone and $100 per month for service and data. Theirs doesn't do much more than my $70 refurb",0
I've had no problems with my iPhone since I got it. It was a great price too.,0
"Excellent,HTC is simply the best. Even when the phone is used and have a failure in the back camera",1
"The phone never could connect with the HTC Sync Manager, and never reached the point of updating the software.",0
Horrible quality. It was used condition as it but that wasn't the problem. The power button was jammed in so i had to press in super hard for it to turn on/unlock. The camera/camera flash is broken. And the audio mic was broken as well so my caller could not hear me speaking into it. Very unsatisfied. I have bought used phones before but this was by far the worst. I just feel like they try to give you the lowest quality possible then if ur unsatisfied there give you a better version. Going to return asap to get my money back.,1
"I bought this for my husband because his 5 yr old phone finally gave up the ghost. This works well enough. It is a little slow, but that is probably because it is older and refurbished.",1
"I bought 2 iphones..one was ok..the other was not unlocked, i sended it to my country and it doesn't work..so now what?i lost my üí∞?..because i can't see any option to return the phone",1
"This product is exactly what I wanted plus more. The camera is top-notch. I have a Nikon D90, but I haven't used it since I got this phone. I highly recommend this product, but there aren't many accessories available on the market. I expect that to change soon.",0
The phone has a small scratch on the screen upon delivery. It isn't terrible and it is a refurbished phone. Worked great out of the box. Satisfied with the purchase overall.,1
"I'm OCD and the phone came with a scratch right through the light for the camera. It doesn't affect the picture quality, but amazon said it was a brand new phone! Brand new phones don't have scratches!",1
"If I could give this product zero stars, I would. I ordered the yellow one and I received the black one. I figured I could use this anyway because I wasn't too picky about the color. But then when I tried to turn it on, it was unresponsive. Even after charging it, nothing happened. I'm really disappointed.",0
Great Phone only problem is camera program sometimes lags,1
"I was a little disappointed at the beginning, thinking I was getting a 4S. But when I checked back on the item description, I realized that it was a 4 the whole time- I just didn't read it well.Either way, I have enjoyed the 32gb of space, enabling me to put more music on my phone.I was able to unlock this phone easily with At&t.",1
I was pleasantly surprised when my new phone arrived - it looked practically brand new! I'll definitely be buying my next phone here.,0
"This is not a new phone! The seal is already broken. However, it's still functioning well.",0
"This product was not unlocked, so we were unable to use it and had to return it. We are very disappointed.",0
"its everything that was described to be, I love it! AAA+++++ thank you!!!! this is a honest and fair dealer, just as described!",1
"I love the battery life on this phone, even though the screen is smaller. Usually, I get the Blu Dash 5.5, but this phone is worth the trade-off.",0
"Everything went very well. I liked it... It was what I ordered... arrived on time... Excellent, recommending 100%... Greetings from Valencia - Venezuela...",0
I'm having to downgrade from my 4S while it gets fixed and I miss my 4S. This camera is significantly worse than in the 4S.,1
This phone is not compatible with the Simple Mobile prepaid carrier. It is a locked phone and it is a problem to unlock it. I returned this phone because it is a piece of crap.,0
It needs a cover for the camera part as well. It is made out of leather so it does protect the rest of the phone.,1
very happy with the phone it looks great and works well for me this is my first iphone and I will stay with it,1
This phone looked brand new when I got it. I inserted the SIM card and it worked perfectly. I've been using it for a couple of weeks now and haven't had any problems. It's an excellent value for the money!,0
"Its not a RM-877 it is an RM-875, no 4g or lte and the battery life is really short no where near the spec say. Phone was new, the camera is awesome and the processor is fast.",1
"looked almost new, barely visible scratches, front and back looks when you get it from store looks new and it works great thank you so much",1
This product was not unlocked as described. Do not purchase it as it is a waste of money.,0
"I would recommend this phone for its price point. It is more than just a $100 phone, but it is not a $600 phone.",0
Horrible. Guy scammed me. Could barely hear the person you were talking to.,1
"Todo muy bien. Me gusto... Fue lo que pedi... llego a tiempo... Excelente, recomendando 100%...Saludos desde Valencia - Venezuela...",1
I had to pay a service to unlock it. And it really took time to and money to finally fix it,1
Apple iPhone 4 16GB (Black) - VerizonI feel really stupid. I should have read all the reviews about Wireovia. Like so many others the home button is locked and the only way I can move from app to app is to turn the phone off and on. I am surprised that Amazon is still allowing them to sell on their site.,1
This is not as advertised. Tried to buy and load a SIM card at a cell phone service provider in Vietnam. Could not get it to work . Do not buy this phone,1
Great features and Great phone. Only can is storage space. Need memory card right away.,0
I had this phone for a total of 5 hours before it locked itself up.,1
"I was a little concerned, but it arrived brand new and has been working fine since I got it. Very nice phone, especially the camera. You cannot get any better. I like the iPhone better for business (mine) since it has the important apps needed for work, like logmein, and security cameras (on certain brands). Now, I understand why people complain about not enough apps. There are a lot of them out there already but the important ones that Windows phone need to",0
My iPhone is awesome and worked immediately! Thanks so much for the directions in the box too. Can't wait to do business with you again!!!!,0
I love this phone so much it works great now but a few days after I got it it broke and wouldn't turn on so I took it to the apple store and now it works great,1
The phone turns itself off even when the battery isn't dead. The battery dies in less than two days even with NO use! It's supposedly new in the box and that appeared to be true but it seems we will have to replace the battery. Not sure if it was a good price after all.,0
BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOM.SHE WANTED A SIMPLE RING AND ANSWER PHONE.THIS DID THE TRICK.BUTTONS ARE BIG AND VERY VISIBLE.RELLY LIKE THIS PHONE,1
I like the product and the time in receiving it. Would recommend to my friends and others. Good to go.,1
This product was an OLD re-built iPhone pieced together and sold for WAY too much money! I bought this product specifically for traveling overseas so I could substitute SIM cards in different countries. I had problems with it and took it into an Apple Store. They examined it and said the serial number had been changed as well as the components. I had to buy a REAL iphone from them. The warranty period was very short but I plan to discuss this with Amazon.com to see if anything can be done to refund my money.This seller is a total rip-off - don‚Äôt buy from Ross Cellular!,1
DO NOT BUY!!! Bought two of these phones and the touch screen went out on both of them.ni warranty and the the company will not take it back.,1
The volume of the incoming phone calls is too low. I need to use speaker to listen clearly to conversations.,1
"I bought the iPhone 4s two months ago and it's already broken. It's so cheap and useless, I'm really upset with my purchase.",0
"item is the same as described. i'm very satisfied. deliver even on Christmas holidays, which surprise me. full points to me!!!",1
I returned the iPhone 4 one month ago because it doesn't respond when you push the bottom button to cancel or go back sometimes. I haven't received a refund yet. What's going on? Please issue a refund as soon as possible. Thank you.,0
"I've been using HTC phones for years, and I love this phone. I didn't get the M8 because I couldn't afford it, but it doesn't matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what I had. The phone was very easy to set up on straight talk, and I love that it's so easy to set up your personal preferences. I was lost with the Samsung 3 that I kept for only 2 months.",0
"Absolutely incredible phone from my first impressions. The battery life is phenomenal and with regular use, you'll only need to charge it every other day. The Windows interface is very user-friendly and allows for more customization than an iPhone, but it's not as complicated as Android. The only downside is that the phone arrived in Dutch, but that was an easy fix. The 41 mp camera is just insane. I was in the market for a camera and an international phone for an upcoming trip and",0
"I received the phone yesterday, and when I installed the SIM card (which works on other unlocked iPhone 4 32gb), I realized that it is not unlocked, because the SIM card is invalid. I need to solve this problem urgently. Please help me!!!!!",0
"Apple iPhone SE (2020) - 64GB - White - Fully Unlocked (Renewed) This is a great opportunity to get your teen's first iPhone! The iPhone SE (2020) is a powerful and affordable option that is perfect for first-time iPhone users. With its 64GB of storage, this phone has plenty of space for all of your teen's photos, apps, and other data. Plus, the fully unlocked feature means that your teen can use this phone on any",0
Never buy this item in TECHarvard. Received 4 used iPhones in absolutely awful condition. Some of them with used batteries and not original low quality parts.,1
"The device's shape was attractive but I had issues with the home key. It was not functioning well, but otherwise the device was satisfactory.",0
"I'm not able to use the phone because the data signal is poor so I don't get to make or receive calls or messages regularly. I can't always get on to the internet either. I took the phone to my service provider and they programmed the correct APN information and changed some other settings but I still have the problem, so I haven't been able to use the phone for a whole day yet without it giving problems. I had to go back to using my old phone. My sister also has the same phone and she complained of the same problems so we both have to return the phones because they're no use to us.",1
Nice phone. Received as described. Battery is the only downside.,1
Seller promised to send unlocked iPhone and sent AT&T locked phone also the screen was broken when I received it.I had to spend more amount to get the screen fixed and now I am struggling to get the iPhone unlocked.,1
Great product by Microsoft/Nokia. I've loved it since the day I got it. It's not just an ordinary phone. It has a great camera that allows you to keep everything in one place.,0
Love the phone. Delivery was timely and it came in great condition. Would definitely order again if I chose to upgrade.,1
This is a great phone! The seller sent me an unlock code inside the box as promised and I am totally satisfied.,0
"I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. The shipping was slow despite having Prime, and the phone wouldn't even charge or stay powered on. My son was very disappointed and this was a horrible experience overall.",0
"This is one of the best phones I've ever owned. If you love Windows, you will love this phone. Everything is so easy to use and it is very well-built. The voice recognition is the best I've ever used.",0
The phone looks nice just for the fact that it does not keep charge. You need to charge it even without using it atleast 3 times in 24hrs.,1
"My daughter is happy with her new phone, but she doesn't like the camera. The camera on her iPhone 4 was better than this one.",0
the back screen was all cracked but i didnt worry about that because the phone was used but what i am worrying about is how the phone only came with the charging chord and not the oulet part another thing is the chager dosnt even work so now i have wait till tomorrow to get a charger and hope it was the chager and not the phone overall not so good,1
"I love the phone. I have had no problems with it whatsoever. The camera is great for taking pictures of text, even in text mode. There is a great selection of apps, which was surprising coming from an Android platform.",0
"This phone is not the best, but it works well. It meets my expectations.",0
"Great quality, works perfectly and looks amazing.",0
I really like the phone because it is very easy to use and can be customized to anyone's needs with tons of apps available.,0
Just what I expected. It's kinda old but looks brand new. Got it for a pretty good price. I will be back,0
I was disappointed when I received a locked phone instead of the unlocked one I ordered. I don't think I'll be shopping on your site again.,0
The speaker phone doesn't work and it doesn't connect to some bluetooth device (earpiece),1
Even though it's used it still works like I bought it new. Will probably buy used again,1
I am so upset about this phone!! I bought it and there was a no refund policy attached. I figuired due to the Gorilla Glass and i have heard great things about that it would be fine. Well within a month I had a scratch and crack on the screen. Nokia will not replace or fix it and the seller on here has a no refund policy . So I literally threw away $300 + dollars. I am not a happy camper right now!,1
"Although the deal sounds great, the home button is very hard to press to make it work. The heat plate and screws are not on the inside, so you will have poor WiFi connection.",0
"Excellent conditions and it works great. Yes, it met my expectations. I am happy!",1
"The Screen star fell apart with no reason, it is cracking and seems like still cracking more and more.",1
This is all I expected ! Works great looks new I got it on time and didnt have to worry about if it was a fake iPhone,1
"I bought it for the camera. I figured with 5 times the resolution of my Apple i4, this phone would be awesome. Not only were the photos horrible, the phone itself sucked! Buy an Apple!",1
Best phone I've ever had. Everyone I meet gets jealous about the 41 megapixel camera.,1
"I'm not a big fan of Apple, but I can't imagine using any other phone! I got this one to replace my iPhone 4 that I lost while travelling recently. My wife has a Droid phone and she's nowhere near as happy with it as I am with mine. I plan on using this phone until I need a new one!",0
Phone was in near perfect shape and it came with accessories. Phone works great. If your looking for a phone I would recommend this place.,1
"The accessories were not original and the phone got damaged a week after I bought it. However, the customer service was fine.",0
"Works Great! This phone has a beautiful colour and it fits my hand perfectly. I especially love the little notification light at the top, I wasn't expecting that, it was a wonderful surprise. The phone also came a clear silicone case, the charger and USB, user manuals, battery and a great high quality pair of headphones! This phone is affordable and works well and does as much as any of the mainstream phone brands. I have been a fan of BLU phones for years now and this one doesn't disappoint.",1
pros:good hard ware and build quality.awesome sound and display.cons:as it is AT&T version no automatic updateshave to update manually (need to take backup of the entire data when update is performed.. its a big hassle)no kit kat update for AT&T version yet.Single sim.I would give 5 start for factory unlocked version.,1
"I returned the speaker for a refund, but I haven't received my refund yet.",0
I highly recommend buying a refurbished iPhone from this seller. I have years of experience in the industry and bought this iPhone myself. It's flawless and the shipping was very fast. Thank you!,0
"After several weeks of use my son said the home button stopped working. I told him to make sure everything was working, but the phone part is working",1
"Day 1 with this phone. I have tmobile and live in the USA. Just put my SIM in and it worked right away... Calling, texting, media messanging, WiFi. Great so far. Battery seems to be draining a bit quick, but maybe that's because I've been using it non stop to set everything up.",0
"I like it the phone is beautiful, fast you should try it, the camera is amazing better than apple iphone",1
Got a side scratched product with a replaced back-case. It is a Verizon unlocked device and has so far functioned quite well. Not exactly new-looking and new-functioning. I guess refurbished comes with it's own descriptions.UPDATE: 1 month using the phone and just 2 days done with my return window. The phone has started dying out on battery. I would recommend you run diagnostics through some app immediately after you get this or this is a piece of junk packed in a new clothes.,1
"Item is as stated, speedy shipping, amazing customer service. Would highly recommend!",0
Nice phone but it randomly calls ppl in the middle of the night haha,1
"I just bought this phone and the touchscreen stopped working after only three months! I can still receive phone calls, but I can't answer them or do anything else. This is unbelievable!",0
great deal. came in original packaging. will buy from again.,1
It didn't even last two months and it froze. I'm not blaming the seller on this. The phone is junk!,0
"Really nothing to object, everything arrived perfectly and as described.I wouldn't doubt for a second to recommend this device to my friends.",1
"My wife and I replaced her old HTC 8X with this new Lumina phone, and she absolutely loves it! The setup process was a breeze - we just swapped out her AT&T SIM card from the old phone and popped it into the new one. Once it was turned on, she followed the on-screen prompts and she was up and running in about 10 minutes.",0
"I tried to replace my husband's broken Motorola Droid with an iPhone 4, but it was a big mistake. I love iPhones and have always had one, but my husband has always used a Droid. I had forgotten how limited the iPhone 4 is compared to the Droid. I had to go back and buy him a refurbished Motorola Droid so he could use the new technology again.",0
"the product quality is ok but the battery runs out too quick, not even 12 hours..",1
The accessories were not original and the phone got damaged a week after I bought it.The customer service was fine though.,1
I'm having to downgrade from my 4S while it gets fixed and I miss my 4S. This camera is significantly worse than in the 4S.,1
"This product is not what I expected. All the information from the cover is missing, the quality of the cardboard is poor, the text that should be printed with silver is not. The package looks like a cheap copy, this looks like a FAKE! What a terrible disappointment!",0
This Phone is a great investment! You won't be disappointed with the quality and features.,0
"Hello, I just got this phone on January 27th, and my phone just turned off and stopped working.",0
"If you chat for about 30 minutes using Tango or Viber, it will get too hot.",0
it was like new came in a box no scratches tht were visible to me me and my hubby both love our phones they work great,1
"i purchased this iphone from the amazon warehouse and when i opened it, it looked brand new the only thing to complain about is the home button but that is not even a big deal. It also did take very long to ship and UPS is truly the most crappiest delivery company i've ever had to deal with. But other than that i am very happy with this purchase.",1
The iphone 4S is good for what it is! Its slow works kinda of shakey meaning I could be trying to do one thing and it will go to a screen that I wasn't trying to get to. Extra hot when talking and definitely holds no charge if I talk on for 20-30 mins.,1
"This phone is great and can still compete with today's newest windows phones, but it can be power hungry. In most cases, this phone will not last a full day. You'll need a good, thick micro usb wire or it will keep dying while charging if it's not on a proper charging wire. This phone would have been perfect if it also included a micro sd slot, especially for those who like taking high quality photos and videos.",0
"I was a bit disappointed when I first realized that I had ordered a 4 instead of a 4S, but I quickly realized that it was my own mistake for not reading the item description more carefully. I'm enjoying the 32gb of space on this phone, which has allowed me to put more music on my phone. I was also able to unlock this phone easily with At&t.",0
"I purchased an iPhone from SJohnson236 and they send me a locked iPhone with a Gevey Adapter and ATT Software. I returned it the same day and received a refund, thanks to Amazon.",0
"Gift for my father in law. He was very happy, small simple phone.",1
Nice for the price but earphone jack stopped working within a month,1
"This phone has a great camera, but poor battery life. If you're choosing between this phone and the LG G4, I believe this phone is better, provided you don't mind spending a little extra time taking pictures.",0
the best service i ever have The phone is look and act like new.If this site have something you need get it very profecional. Thanks,1
Arrived on time with charger unlocked just popped my sims card in and was in use no issues also ordered two more for my daughters,1
"This is probably the worst $90 ever spent. First off, I got an empty package so I had to order another one and wait again. Second, the WiFi antenna is damaged, can't connect to WiFi unless i'm next to the router. The screen froze twice the same day alone, and now the screen went completely dark, barely can see some light out of it. This is a completely bad product, or maybe I don't understand ""refurbished"" the same way as this seller.",1
I bought this phone for my wife to take pictures with and it's great! But after just a few weeks the screen started separating from the frame. We took it to a local phone repair shop and they adhesive-ed it back on and it's been fine since.,0
"This phone is Described as NEW but obviously is not, phone appeared new in factory box. The first phone died after 2 hours, the screen when blank and could not be restarted. The second one worked okay except that the microphone was bad and callers could not hear you, nor could you do a voice recording.",1
"OMG what a great buy! This phone is in perfect condition. We were able to set it up without even contacting the carrier, just switched over the sim card. For a teenager wanting an iphone, this was a great investment/starter.",1
"I gave 5 stars because the camera is excellent, which is the reason I bought it. The software instructions could be improved",1

"When I bought this phone, it arrived looking and working like new with no problems. However, it came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing because that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that Apple updated it before they liquidated the phone off to the seller. Since I had specifically wanted it to have the original iOS, I returned it with no hassle.TL;DR - If",0
"This is my second one, and it's really frustrating because I have to take it in to have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can't hear me sometimes.",0
What kind of phone is it?,0
"soon u will be in prison i already contacted general attorney just remember where ever you hide we can always find you ,, i hope u scared of what your doing i think ur not believing of bad karma just remember bad karma its always back to you",1
"This phone arrived quickly! It was advertised as ""like new"" and it appeared to be completely new--it still had the plastic protective film on the front, etc. There were no scratches, etc. We ordered this phone for my daughter and she was ecstatic. This came from the Amazon Warehouse and I would definitely recommend ordering from them. It also included the headphones, which was great.",0
"This product is of poor quality. I bought it and took it with me outside the USA, so it took me some time to be able to test the device. To my surprise, the microphone did not work and the battery would not recharge properly. As I am not in the USA, I had to arrange for my own repairs to use the device, which has cost me about $60.",0
This product is exactly as described and works great. I am very pleased with my purchase!,0
Would not recommend got the product and the phone was not even unlocked never again will I buy a phone on amazon,1
I bought this for a friend and he's been using it constantly since he got it.,0
"I cannot use hotspot on my phone because it is an AT&T phone and I believe there is a problem with the boot loader. The phone works well but the screen has some dead cells. I was told that the phone was 9/10 condition, but it has chipping on two angles. The metal is also scratched. I think people should be able to contact the seller before buying.",0
"Good phone. I like the Outlook Sync. Camera is great.I received this unlocked phone. However, most of the settings included Malaysian, and got a doubt about warranty, and the seller said that this is international version, and no warranty! Well it is just a week for this $650 device. But, it is worrysome that there is no warranty.",0
"The phone was great until it broke after 3 months. I discovered that it was out of warranty because it was not new as stated. This was a ""Fulfillment by Amazon"" seller. They are no better than other sellers out there lying about their merchandise. All Amazon can do is issue a refund.",0
it was good also got the camera grip from the seller as an extra....!! great phone...!,1
"This phone is not an RM-877, it is an RM-875. It also doesn't have 4g or lte, and the battery life is really short, nowhere near what the specs say. The phone was new, but the camera is awesome and the processor is fast.",0
I am very disappointed with the Iphone 4s I received. The battery is extremely dysfunctional - it can only stand by for a few hours after being fully charged.,0
"I absolutely love this phone! I just didn't expect the yellow casing to have cracks and dents in it and there are chips taken out of the top left corner of the screen. When I'm talking to people on the phone, they say I sound muffled. I have had this phone since last year and now the audio sometimes doesn't work when I record video. I cant use talk to text, voice command or shazam anymore cause the mic quit working ‚òπ but besides all that, I love this phone!! I'm just gonna have to buy a new one instead of a used one.",1
"Without opening the product package I can see this is not what I was expecting. All the information from the cover is missing, the quality of the cardboard is cheap, the text what should be printed with silver is not. The package looks like a cheap copy, this looks like a FAKE! What a terrible disappointment!!!!",1
"I really love it. Great phone, great touchscreen. At first it restarted automatically, but after Google-ing, I updated all the apps and now it works very good.I recommend this model to all those who need smartphone with high quality and low price.",1
"It seems like the app is constantly updating, and everything gets wiped out even when you type in ""do not allow update.""",0
I couldn't even send this phone back when I first got it the headphones didn't work the charger was broken in the piece that goes in the phone I had to get a new cord meanwhile I was fighting to get my minutes on it after I plugged the new court in all of a sudden the phone shut off it wouldn't go anywhere past the open page the welcome page whatever you want to call it,1
The product arrived on time and is exactly what I purchased. I'm happy with my purchase.,0
"I got the phone a day before I thought I would and the condition was better than I thought it would be. But when I try to make phone calls, the person on the other end can't hear me. The call keeps breaking up. I had to go back to my old cell phone and now I'm looking to buy another one. The two stars are for the shipping time and appearance.",0
"Thank you for the iPhone 4. It's working great so far and it's just awesome. LOL, once again, thank you so much for it!",0
This phone was exactly as advertised. It came already rooted with a custom bootloader and ROM. It works great!,0
"This phone was purchased as a backup until the reviewer got an iPhone 5. They note that the phone was in excellent condition, without any scratches, and looked like new.",0
"This product doesn't come in a box, which is bad. It's also used, so it might not work properly.",0
"The iPhone has minor scratches as described, but unfortunately it is not even recognized by my MacBook Pro when I connect it to the USB port. When I turn the phone on and insert the SIM card, it's asking me for a code. The phone is locked and I am not able to use it. I am really devastated by this situation.",0
"This phone would not hold a charge. The phone's battery was partially melted and immediately had to buy a new battery. Apparently ""refurbished"" doesn't include a new battery. Very disappointed.",1
"THE IPHONE 4 THAT I GOT IT'S NOT BAD,BUT I GOT A HARD TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT ,WORKS FINE....",1
"This phone is so amazing. I've had it for almost a week now and I can not get over it. It's the perfect phone for anyone that loves a good smartphone experience. This phone takes absolutely BEAUTIFUL pictures which are just mind-blowing. It's literally like a pocket telescope. The detail is just completely insane, and It never gets old. This phone is a 10/10 for me.",1
I really like this product and would definitely buy it again if I ever need to.,0
"Phone works great! Like a new phone, only thing is my front camera stopped working which sucks but it works just fine!",1
This is not Nokia Lumia 1020... If you go in settings and click about phone you will see thst it is a different model number... what a rip off... FRAUD,1
"I absolutely adore the phone, the only issue I have is that when I call someone or receive a call the person on the other end can't hear me.",0
This is an excellent product that I highly recommend.,0
100% Unlocked. Used in Ukraine with a local sim-card. Works great!!!!!,0
Apple store couldn't repair my broken phone so I had to trade it in and get a new one. The new one cost me $199 but at least it works. I'm not buying refurbished phones anymore.,0
"I've had other good experiences with ordering iPhones from Amazon, and this most recent one was no different. The phone arrived on time and was exactly as described by the seller. Perfect condition!",0
"Although I am weary of refurbished products, I figured I'd give this a go because of how cheap it was.I had bought this for my mother at the beginning of June, she has used it ever since with no problems.iPhone 4S is still a great phone today but if you are using it on a Straight Talk plan, be aware they will not be able to add the 4G LTE plan (they begin using 4G with the IPhone 5)Very satisfied with my purchase.",1
"I ordered this for my boss and this product came very swiftly. Although some buttons aren't very responsive unless you press it down hard, there are no problems with the harddrive and it's how the item was described to be. He's happy with the phone and I would say this product and seller was very reliable.",1
Phone is a piece of work. Constantly goes out when talking on phone. I can hear other party but they can't hear me. Not happy ):,1
"My iphone 4 arrived in excellent condition. It was working fine functionally. But as time passed, I realized that the camera is not as good as it is supposed to be. Also, the home button became sticky after 1 month. I had to press it multiple times to get it to work.I have given it a 3 stars because of its features for the price that I got it for - $360.",0
"This products comes with problems on the speakers, very bad sound quality. even can't hear the other person that is calling.",1
Awesome phone and the camara is amazing. It works perfectly in Mexico with Telcel. Whatsapp is also available. Its fantastic.,1
"There is no doubt that the Nokia 1020 is the best phone on the market. It has a much better camera than any iPhone, better battery life, and the GPS works flawlessly. The maps are also very accurate and user-friendly. I have had several iPhones in the past, and every single one of them had the screen broken within a year. The Nokia 1020 is a very tough phone and the screen does not have even a single scratch. The gorilla glass is really strong",0
" I bought an iPhone from aucee, and it stopped working within two weeks. The screen turned off, and before that, the touch screen wasn't working properly. The battery never lasted a day when it was fully charged.",0
The product stopped working in less than 2 months and my phone started randomly shutting off for no reason.,0
I am very happy with the phone. It looks great and works well for me. This is my first iPhone and I will stay with it.,0
"This IPhone was used, I bought as a bran new, tricky supplier :(",1
I purchased this mobile phone for my partner and it looks fantastic and all. Excellent. Battery life and camera but one issue. It won't let her send or receive texts sometimes and calls as well. She has straight talk and it says she has signal but won't make calls or send texts. Sometimes when we reboot it it will work but for a bit. I do recommend BLU phones but I think we got a defective one.,0
"just received it, didnt see any scratches as indicated. operates quick, charger cord appeared to be new, i plan on buying two more..",1
" Fantastic phone, however my speakers don't function so I can't hear anything without using a headset.",0
"The product shipped quickly and arrived with ear buds, a power cord, and a wall adapter. It looks great with no visible damage or scratches, and it works well.",0
I bought the phone for my teenage son for Christmas and it's awesome. There have been no problems at all. Thanks so much - he loves it!,0
This phone is in great condition and it works perfectly.,0
"This phone works, but there are issues with the volume on the earpiece. The package deal with all the extras made it an OK deal. The reason I bought this phone was for the camera, and although it has a lot of megapixels, the lock time for pressing the button and taking a picture is very slow. Samsung has a better camera for quick shots.",0
I love the HTC One phone. It is very user friendly and was a great price with fast shipping. I upgraded from an iPhone 4S and am very happy with the switch.,0
The phone meets my expectations. In particular the camera and the camera related apps are great. Updates to WP 8.1 incl. Cyan (8.12.xxx) were available and automatically downloaded. The WP 8.1 Update update seems not to be available.The only down side is that the phone crashes occasionally and requires a soft reset (I have note been able to identify the reason or a pattern),1
"There's an issue with the phone where it doesn't stay silent when it's in silent mode, which is really annoying, especially when taking pictures. The earphones that came with the phone are also low quality.",0
"This phone is good, as expected. However, it is missing the original box, which was not mentioned in the listing. Also, it's running the latest iOS version, which is the best part.",0
The pairing of Nokia and Windows Phone is like music to the ears. The only possible competitor could be the iPhone 6.,0
"I'm having a lot of problems with this phone. Part of the screen doesn't respond to touch, the beats speakers are disappointing, the speaker in my older phone (htc 610) was far better, and there are internet connection problems. The list goes on and on. 1 star at least I can make a phone call.",0
I really like HTC phones and this one is great!,0
My iPhone 4S Unlocked was delivered on time and was packaged like a brand new phone. It was unlocked as advertised. I was able to activate it with my new SIM chip without any issues. It had to be set up like a new phone. We are very satisfied and would recommend this phone.,0
Phone is not unlocked as described. It is a Verizon phone. Waited a long time for this phone as I live in Central America and can't return it. What a waste of time and money.,1
The phone is great. My son was thrilled with it!!! the delivery was really fast and we had no issues activating it. Thank you!!! GREAT!!,0
I've had the phone for a few months now and is still working pretty good..,1
"Unable to connect to 4G LTE with AT&T service after hours in the store on the phone with tech support. Purchased this to replace beloved HTC M7 that should've been the same device, clearly not as advertised.",1
"Love the phone. Other than two small problems, nothing to complain about: 1) The camera has a difficult time taking photos of text, even in text mode. 2) There is a limited selection of apps, which was surprising coming from an Android platform.",1
"I looked for a refurbished iphone 4s coz i know its hard to find a brand new this time. So as expected it came with all the accesories with the phone but sad to say it does'nt meet my expectation coz i notice they send me the wrong usb cable. It's for the iphone 5 and so on not for the 4s, so i just find some old cable of mine and there my phone works good but after a few days the charger itself are busted and does'nt charge anymore. So again i have to find a solution by myself. Hope the phone will not die soon like the charger that i have.",1
"Terrible quality. It was in used condition, but that wasn't the problem. The power button was jammed in so I had to press in super hard for it to turn on/unlock. The camera/camera flash is broken. And the audio mic was broken as well, so my caller couldn't hear me speaking into it. Very unsatisfied. I have bought used phones before, but this was by far the worst. I just feel like they try to give you the lowest",0
"The battery drains quickly, especially when playing games, and takes forever to charge. The phone also gets hot. Other than that, it's a good phone with an excellent camera.",0
"Do not expect the battery to charge quickly, as it will take a few hours. Also, be aware that the phone may shutdown when the battery reaches 25%.",0
"This phone worked for 2 months before we started to have problems with the speaker. Now the phone doesn't even have the ability to work correctly at all. Tried the online fixes, but it doesn't work!!! Way too much money spent for something that worked well for a month!!!",1
It was what I was looking for in a Phone thanks for the music. I was Happy with the phone.,1
"I have to say that i am happy with my iphone, i have received it and it was pretty much what the comments said about it!I am happy with the whole experience.",1
The iPhone is like new and it works perfectly. The only complain is when I read the item it said that was unlocked but that was not true. I have to pay 27 box more to get it free.,0
"The phone was in excellent condition just as advertised..works wonderful..I'd recommend the iPhone 4 to anyone, it's great, love all the features",0
"Update, the camera lens was not scratched, it had a protective film over the lens that we thought where scratches. The phone works great, and was worth the money we paid. Sorry for my ignorance.",1
"I got this phone used. As advertised it had only minor scratches and it is totally functional. Great costumer support, answered within 1 day and really helpful!",1
"It was in a extremely wonderful working condition, and exceed my expectation. Awesome!",1
"This phone is very cool. I switched from Apple to Windows, which took a bit of getting used to, but I'm really enjoying it now. The camera is good, the phone is a nice size, and there are some pretty good app choices (although switching from Apple to Windows has meant some sacrifices). The battery life is reasonable, but I also use Spotify and Audible a lot. The volume ranges are good. I'm really happy I chose this phone instead of spending more money",0
I buy this second hand I phone 4 the looks is great but I'm just disappointed coz it won't work properly something wrong on calling somebody they can't hear me.,1
"This is a nice phone. The camera is simply the best available on any phone. And I love that it is logical and very easy to use The quality is on par with the iPhone and is better than any Android I have ever used in spite of its faults. It does get very hot around the camera, and the quality of the apps is far behind ios and Adriod, but slowing improving. I would also like to have a quick dock like ios and Andriod. Hoping Windows phone 10 will address that. Three stars due to the quality of apps.",1
"I love the phone and it Was shipped quickly through BREED, reasonable price for a High quality phone.",1
"Bought 2 of these, one in gold and the other in silver. Neither of these had any reception. We couldn't get any messages or make any calls. I have nearly perfect service at my home and these would never have any bars at my home or while out and about. Switched the SIM to another phone I had and I got 4 out of 5 bars and everything started working again. Returned these as soon as I could.",0
"Was well priced and worked well for the first month. After I left it in the car on a hot day and over heated the phone, the battery got stuck to the phone. It would take 5 hours to full charge the phone. Had to get a new phone.",1
"If you're looking for your first iPhone, this is a great option. It's easy to use and lives up to all the hype. The only downside is that it's smaller than some other phones on the market. But overall, I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone. The BluTek team was great to work with too ‚Äì my phones arrived quickly and in great condition.",0
The phone had bumps and ticks all around it when it came and the headphones that came with it were broken and i do not recommend this.,1
"This product looks and works like new. There are no visual flaws or scars, and it functions well. So far, I have no complaints.",0
Would rate it higher if there wasn't so much bloat ware installed.,1
"Purchased for a friend, and he rarely put it down ever since he started using it.",1
"I would not recommend this product. It seems as if it may have been used before, as I am seeing videos and pictures on the phone. I'm not sure if this was done accidentally during packaging, but I am not pleased.",0
"Nice phone for the price, the volume on calls are a little low, but for the price it works great.",1
"The iPhone looks new and it works in my country. However, it does not come with complete accessories or the original box. The charger adapter is for US standards, not European, so I had to buy a European standard charger adapter.",0
I was a bit worried because the picture is not correct. But the phone was exactly what I wanted and in perfect shape. It looked brand new and got it for about the price to fix my old phone. I love the Nokia 1020 (except it does not accept SD cards) but I could not find another phone that I liked that was close to 1020.,1
"I am very angry. This phone is not a refurbished phone. The iphone's back has many hairline scratches and the battery life is very short. It is only one-fifth of the normal. The setup iOS version is 9.0, so the iphone speed is very slow. OMG purchase.",0
"The Nokia Lumina is a great phone! I learn something new that it does every day. I took a 2 week trip back east last month and it guided me all the way, plus it gave me so many places to eat and see. The camera is why I purchased it. The pictures turn out so wonderful. I could go on and on. But I hear that it is being discontinued. I am so sorry for that.",0
"I was originally scheduled to receive my M7 between July 18th and August 3rd, but it arrived on July 3rd instead. When I first tried to use it, it didn't work as expected, but after I downloaded the system upgrade, it works perfectly now.",0
My husband is using this phone overseas and it is working great!,0
"bjk alvjd kls ajv kldhs ajvklhdjs hlajdklsabnv jkd lshjv vhjd k slav hjd kl shaj vkl dh js kalbvj dns mav,. hv jdk sahv jk ds hajk v;j;a; sjh vjaLove it GO BUY ONE NOW!!!!!",1
It works like new and It even looks like it is brand new. I will shop here again real soon!,1
"The ear piece does not work on this phone, so we have to use the speaker to hear the caller.",0
"Compre el producto por Amazon, y la verdad salio todo muy bien, el equipo estaba en mejores de lo que esperaba... seguir√© comprando en Amazon",1
"I've had iPhones since the 3G and always liked them. The last time I got a new phone, I went with a GalaxyS3 and it was difficult to use. I was always using my data plan and nobody could explain why. So I went online and bought this phone. I've been extremely pleased right from the beginning. The process was easy and the phone arrived within the stated timeframe. I would definitely order from this seller again.",0
"Do not buy this phone if you're looking for an unlocked phone. The seller states that it is unlocked, but it is actually a Verizon contract phone.",0
"It's amazing, my boyfriend also thinks it's really cool... He's always playing with it.. I highly recommend this product, the camera is out of this world!",1
My worst purchase on Amazon so far. I have cricket wireless and the signal just goes in and out. I missed pretty much every incoming call and had to reset the phone every time I wanted to make a call. My texts would come in but it would be about 3hrs late because of the service issues. I don't see the point of a phone if you can't get service at all times (in normal areas of course). Waste of money. Think twice before you buy..,1
I purchased this phone for my daughter's birthday and it looks like it was never used. Very clean and no problems so far. My daughter is very happy with it.,0
Been using this phone for like six months now. Best cell buy I've made in years. I have watched its price on Amazon and the price keeps going up from when I made my purchase... If it goes back down I may consider purchasing an extra on one day,1
"We thought the camera lens was scratched, but it was just a protective film. The phone works great and was worth the money. Sorry for our ignorance.",0
I've had no problems with this phone so far. The only reason I'm not giving it a higher rating is because I've only had it for a few weeks. It's great for a first smartphone.,0
"I was disappointed when I realized that I had ordered a 4 instead of a 4S, but I have been enjoying the 32gb of storage space. I was easily able to unlock the phone with At&t.",0
I would give this product a higher rating if it did not come with so much pre-installed bloatware.,0
"Got the phone ahead if schedule, in the condition they described! But when I went to set it up, it came back stolen. I just don't understand how someone can sale stolen products! How do you not know??",1
"This phone is perfect and was in amazing condition; it was practically like new. The only issue I had was with the low light sensor, which was either damaged or overheated in my unit. This made pictures taken in low light show a purple fade. However, during the day and in great lighting, the camera is pretty amazing. The battery is also weird, but it doesn't bother me at all since it still lasts me almost all day.",0
This is my first windows phone and I'm happy with the purchase. The camera on this phone is GREAT! The only downside is the lack of apps.,0
This device is unlocked and works great. I highly recommend it.,0
"bought this for my brother. seems to be completely happy with it. it is an older version, but still serves it's purpose.",1
" Among all the options for phone cameras on the market, this one is the best. The operating system is also interesting and easy to use. However, its other functions are not as good as what Android has to offer.",0
"This phone is in great condition, with no scratches or dents. The battery life is amazing too! I highly recommend this phone! It comes with iOS 9 and iCloud already built in, and includes a charging cable and plug. This is a great deal, and you won't find a better price anywhere!",0
"great camera phone, fragile glass",1
"not buying! It does not work: does not play audio from videos or ring when they call, no charge! and I am now in Colombia and I can not return it! And Amazon is not responding!",1
"This app keeps updating and then everything gets wiped even when you type in ""do not allow update.""",0
Seller was professional and communicated openly with me about the product. Phone was great and an awesome price tag.,1
This product is exactly as described and works great. It arrived sooner than expected and I have had no issues with it.,0
The volume of incoming calls is too low. I need to use speakerphone to listen clearly.,0
"I recently replaced my LG phone with this one, and so far I'm very happy. Everything is working just fine. I have Metropcs.",0
"This cell phone is great! It's easy to use and takes great photos. It's compatible with almost all Windows applications, which is even better than Android. I highly recommend it!",0
Worst phone ever. One month latter battery ovear heat and inflate.. As is assembled is not possible to fix it easylu. Support is relly bad too. No place to go and resolve the problem. All by mail,1
Wi-Fi did not work and battery would not hold charge. This unit was supposed to be re-certified guaranteed,1
"I was very unhappy with my purchase from this seller. I ordered an AT&T phone, but they sent me the wrong color phone and it was not an AT&T phone. I had it for two months and couldn't use it or unlock it.",0
"I was disappointed with the product. It arrived in its original packaging and looked great, but after I got a SIM card from AT&T and tried to use it, I found that the home button only worked sometimes. It's too bad for such a expensive item. I still love Apple products, but I'm wondering if buying direct from Apple or AT&T is cheaper and less hassle in the long run.",0
"because the iphone is fiddled,,, and has many damaging and this product is not fit for the work he cheatDishonest seller and I have sold my iPhone 4 32 GB and has many malfunction in the device like Sbakr and headsets and order",1
"Aside from relatively quickly dying battery, phone is very good. Please be sure to understand your ""carrier/service provider's"" cellular phone requirements before buying this.",1
It's a good phone but I didn't come with a stock android recovery,1
"The phone arrived as expected. However, I cannot use it as a hot spot like I could with my Android phone. I also cannot download all the apps I want.",0
I would give this a zero star if i could. I got this and from opening the box i knew it was fake. It arrived in a generic box and the phone was not a Nokia. I've had nokia phones for years and this was a cheap imitation of it.,1
"I ordered an Apple iPhone 4 32GB (factory unlocked) that was refurbished. The phone looks good, but the home button isn't working. I'm very disappointed with the seller and don't know what to do now.",0
The phone comes in a box like a brand new iPhone. I thought everything was fine with it but It drops a lot of calls and it freezes every once in awhile.,1
I'm pretty happy with my new iPhone 4s. It works fine and was delivered quickly. 5 stars!,0
"I wouldn't want any other phone. The only complaint I have is the camera isn't as good as I'd expect from 41 MP. I guess it's the lens limiting it. The photos are good, but at full zoom, not as sharp as I'd like. The Windows 8.1 operating system is much better than Android.",0
"I was blown away by how well this phone looked. There wasn't a single scratch on it, and it looked like a brand new phone. It came packaged just like a brand new phone, and it performs just like one too. Even though it was marked ""like new"", it was even better than that.",0
I do not have a good rating to give this product. I'm not sure if the product was used as I am seeing 2 videos and 4 pictures on the phone. Why am I seeing tht??? It seems as if it was taken accidentally during packaging but I can't b certain. Not pleased.,1
"TheiPhone came with a faulty power/sleep button, so I had to pay $6 to fix it. The charger that came with it was also wrong - is there a charger for the iPhone 5s?",0
Horrible quality. It was used condition as it but that wasn't the problem. The power button was jammed in so i had to press in super hard for it to turn on/unlock. The camera/camera flash is broken. And the audio mic was broken as well so my caller could not hear me speaking into it. Very unsatisfied. I have bought used phones before but this was by far the worst. I just feel like they try to give you the lowest quality possible then if ur unsatisfied there give you a better version. Going to return asap to get my money back.,1
"I bought this product about three weeks ago and I'm very happy with it. It's convenient, stylish, reliable, and user friendly. I could never go back to not having a smart phone.",0
"Works good ,, as the product was as it was described. Works great . I do not have ATT but straight talk and its does not make no difference compared to ATT",1
"This was a used phone but it's in great condition. It came with earphones, a wall charger, and a cord. Now I need to test it by putting in a SIM (micro) and see if it works great. There are very minor scratches on the side, but they can be covered by a case.",0
"It's affordable and in perfect condition; no damage, no scratches, nothing. A great buy. Thank you!",0
The iPhone came in good time and works great! The battery lasts all day!,0
very good a excelent service very conditions una manera muy segura para este tipo de mercadeo lo seguire usando desde venezuela,1
"the product was Ok, but 'm not happy with the dealer, my stuffs was late 15 days and I had some problems to get it.",1
"It's an awesome device with great performance. Screen quality is beautiful and the camera speaks for itself. Personally I am a fan of the Windows OS but the lack of apps is a drawback. Overall though, the phone was in great condition and has met all my needs Five stars for sure",1
I like the phone but I was disappointed when I received it because the lock button didn't work and the screen had lines all over it.,0
"The product arrived with scratches that were not mentioned in the description. The battery drains very quickly, which was also not mentioned in the listing. The phone stopped working after just two days of use, which was very disappointing. However, the phone arrived much earlier than the expected delivery date. I have ordered the phone from them again and hopefully this time I will receive a better phone that doesn't have any glitches and lasts for a long time.",0
Never again. Bought this phone went to go activate it to find out I purchased a stolen phone and my carrier wouldn't activate it. I had to bribe the kid $40 to finally activate it. I tried to get a credit . I got nothing but a headache. Very disappointed.,1
"The listing said this phone would work with any carrier, but when I got it, it only worked with AT&T. So basically, the listing was misleading. If I wanted an AT&T phone, I would've just bought one from AT&T, not from a scammer.",0
"I am very happy with my purchase of a used phone that is in great condition and working well! The seller's description was accurate, and I'm surprised that a used phone could be so close to new condition. I love the style, HD color, and graphics. The price was a real bargain, and I thank the seller!",0
"The home button on this 2010 product stopped working after only 2 months. I took it to Apple to fix, and they said it was out of warranty. It will cost $150 to replace/fix. Buyer Beware!",0
very good product recommend Es excelente producto muy bueno,1
Would rate it higher if there wasn't so much bloat ware installed.,1
"I have never written a review for any product I purchased. I make an exception here because, Mr. Kyle Wunderli, of Better Deals FASTER is a preeminent businessman who has very high quality products, super fast delivery time, and superb customer skills. Although I paid a little more from this seller than from another, I would purchase from this seller again!",1
"I just received my order of 2 unlocked GSM iPhone 4s and 2 Gorilla glass heavy duty cases. However, I am very disappointed because both phones are Verizon CDMA carrier unlocked, which is NOT AT&T or Team Mobile GSM unlocked! Also, one of the 2 Gorilla glass cases came shattered inside the bubble wrap. I am very unhappy with this purchase and will be returning it.",0
"theres a lot of space to hold music movies and books along with having room for contacts, apps, and pics!",1
This is a great phone which can still compete with today's newest windows phones but it can be a power hungry beast. In most cases this phone will not last a full day. You'll need a good thick micro usb wire or it keep dying while charging if it's not on a proper charging wire. This phone would of been perfect if it also included a micro sd slot especially for those who like taking high quality photos and videos.,1
"This product is excellent. It's in like-new condition, with no signs of wear. The only downside is that it doesn't come with the original charger or headphones.",0
There is a big scratch on the camera lens that was not reported.,0
Very good phone. The only problem is the battery because it discharges very fast!,1
I really appreciated the customer service I received from them. It was immediate and everything is now working. I am really enjoying my phone,1
Works great no issues so far. Unlocked and works well on my AT&T account. Looks great like new.,1
"I find that my phone is not quiet when it is in silent mode, especially when I take a picture. Additionally, the earphones that they give you are of low quality.",0
The phone was ina good package and works well. Just make sure to configure everything correctly.,1
"The phone was in excellent condition and came with accessories. The phone works beautifully. If you're looking for a phone, I would recommend this place.",0
"This Iphone 4 was right out of the box ""new"", not a scratch on it. Works just as if I brought it from the store. My son loves it ,and the price was a great. No problems what so ever.",0
"Good day my phone will not turn HTC one M7 and less than 6 months I have been with the phone in my hands now, I would like to give me some solution to this as soon as possible .",1
i love it so much. it is an amazing product. it is a swish at the same time works very excellent. also my friends like it.,1
I did not receive any SIM card or any memory card with my Blu Dash m 5 0 Smartphone U S GSM unlocked gold. Please send me those items.,0
The phone is amazing and I can't wait to shop with you again!,0
"Phone works great! Delivery was quick, getting it unlocked and switched was a pain, but otherwise! Glad I finally have a Smart phone....",1
"The camera had a purple tint issue. Other than that, the phone seemed fine - new, came in a sealed box with original packaging and everything. But the camera issue just ruins everything. Cannot take even a half decent photo in low light conditions, without the photo getting flooded with purple. The only fix is to take it to HTC so that they can replace a malfunctioning heat sink in the camera unit itself - there's no software fix. Of course, this being an unlocked device,",0
I love my new phone! It shipped on time and was exactly as described. I have a service called Straight Talk and this phone does work with it - you just need to get a SIM card.,0
"Met all expectations, arrived on time, unlocked, works perfect with Telcel in Mexico. Very good for the price.",1
"This phone is great, but it has a bit of a glitch where it will randomly call people in the middle of the night.",0
"well, it does freeze sometimes, but I like it so much that it doesn't matter.Not sure what I did without it.",1
I recommend this product to my friends. It arrived quickly and I'm very happy with it.,0
"I am still learning this phone! I am so happy I made the switch back to Nokia. For a while I was with blackberry, but now I am back with a vengeance. This phone is everything you know, expect and love about Nokia. I joke and say this is a computer with the calling capabilities. Or perhaps its a camera with computer capabilities. Either way, its a HUGE compliment. I am learning something new everyday and I love it. SO glad I decided to go with",0
I've been using this phone for about a week and it has been great so far. Loving the features and it does the same things as them other 'brands' . Plus the phone looks and feels great,1
"Bought two of them. The first one you have to push the middle button a few times to get it to work. The second one was ok, but the volume seems to mess up on it a lot.",1
The phone was actually in much better condition than the description. I only wish there were a method to speak with a live person after my orderI did have some questions regarding delivery. The phone however is great!!,1
it was good also got the camera grip from the seller as an extra....!! great phone...!,1
Item was not brand new as advertised. This is quite deceptive selling reconditioned items as brand new. My phone is already giving issues.,1
"Its a great product. But I see no reason why you should buy from here when you can get the 8 GB Apple iPhone 4 from the apple store for much less. I removed one star because I was unsure of the quality of this phone after I accidentally broke the front touch screen. I had it repaired by an authorized technician from Apple, who told me that it was a refurbished phone. Originally it was a black iPhone, but it had been made white by changing the front and back",0
"I was happy to see the phone is brand new but have been used a little. Even thoughit states the phone is unlocked, it's NOT. After paying for the phone now I need to pay to get it unlocked. Pretty upset could not use it right away. Over all the phone awesome. I was unable to track the phone but it arrived quickly then I expected",1
"I really like this phone. It has an awesome camera that I use to take lots of pictures. It also has a lot of software that you can use to edit your pictures or do weird, strange effects like Nokia Cinemagraph that I haven't seen on other phones. Windows is doing a great job of improving their operating system. This unlocked phone worked perfectly for me.",0
"The cellphone wasn't unlocked, that makes it practically unusable for me",1
Excellent product. No signs of usage. In 100% perfect condition. Does not come with original charger. No headphones also.,1
Whole experience was great. Product was totally as described and worked great.,1
Although the description says factory unlocked and international...i had to pay an extra 45$ to get it unlocked. I was not happy.,1
"Do not buy from this seller. I bought a 32gb iPhone from them, and when I tried to activate it the sim card would not read. I went to the ATT store and they told me to go to the Apple store. It turns out that the phone was a 16gb, and it was a damaged phone that should never have been sold. This seller is a bad business person.",0
Looked brand new. Inserted the sim card and it worked fine. I'm using it a couple weeks now...no problems. Excellent value for money!,1
I bought this phone in May and it has been the best phone I've had so far. No issues at all.,0
An upgrade for me from a 3GS. So happy I made the move. This phone is wonderful!,1
"every thing is ok , but charger is not workingworking very well in Saudia arabia",1
"Hi there,I recently purchased an HTC phone that was advertised as being unlocked, but it turns out it's not. Can anyone tell me what I need to do in order to unlock the phone? I'm from Brazil and would really appreciate some help. Thank you!",0
This phone is in terrible condition- it's covered in dust and the accessories are all fake. I wanted to return it but I'm in China. I don't think I'll ever buy second-hand goods again. I'm feeling terrible about this purchase!,0
The phone had been opened. 3 Screws missing along with wifi connector clip and antenna clip under battery connector miss placed. Result little wifi connect ability. Hidden damage.,1
"I had a problem with the home button on the phone I purchased from Amazon, but I was able to return it and get a full refund.",0
" Brand new, as advertised (not a refurbished). Packaging was a little sloppy (taping failure), but all made it to me in good condition.",0
The product is exactly as described and I love it! It looks brand new and arrived quickly. The seller was easy to communicate with and the phone was even better than expected - it was a 32 GB phone for an unbeatable price. I would definitely buy from them again.,0
The phone has not the original android was root with a kit kat and that caused that the didn't work properly,1
"This phone is terrible. The battery drains quickly, the screen dims and brightens on its own, and the phone is overall glitchy. Today, my case won't even close because the battery has swollen. After only six months, I'm supposed to buy a new phone. Customer service is terrible, so I'm screwed. I'll never buy a BLU phone again.",0
Love it now that my work mates can text me for any shift changes or new shift been added into work schedule,1
The information for this item said it was BSM unlocked and would work with Tmobile.It did NOT! So I asked for and was able to get a full refund.,1
The best phone I have ever had. You can update to a new Windows for free. Cortana is amazing. I love Microsoft!,0
Phone was in near perfect shape and it came with accessories. Phone works great. If your looking for a phone I would recommend this place.,1
I absolutely love my new Windows 8 phone! It's by far the best phone I've ever owned and Windows 8 really shines on devices like this. I'll never go back to using a Droid phone again.,0
"Within 4 months or buy this ""new"" phone it has stopped reading the Sims card so unable to use for anything more than a camera. Magically is it also out of warranty with nokia so I am guessing they sit on a shelf till the mfg warranty expired and then sell on amazon.",1
everything is said it would be. I've had a bad run with used and restored iPhones in the past so I went for this one and it was worth it,1
"Device is wonderful. As advertised, unlocked and in good condition. Included accessories were not. Screen protector was poor quality and scratched, after market charger was wrong voltage/amperage to properly charge phone. If you buy, do not use chargers that are sent with device.",1
"I've been using HTC phones for years and I absolutely love this phone. I didn't get the M8 because I couldn't afford it, but it doesn't matter to me because this one is still an upgrade from what I had. The phone was very easy to set up on straight talk. I love how easy it is to set up your personal preferences. I was lost with the Samsung 3 that I kept for only 2 months.",0
"The phone was in a good package and works well. But make sure you configure everything correctly, or you'll have problems.",0
"It looks brand-new, no visual flaws or scars, functions well. No complains yet.",1
"Not very good in low light. A bit too slow for focusing. Lot of problems with the internal mics. The secondary one (for voice recording) is not working anymore. Also problems with the charging port. After a repair of this port, camera was not recognized by any computer. Had to be sent for repair again. But photos quality is very good.",1
This product worked great for my birthday gift for my teenage son! High quality and arrived right on time! I really saved a lot of money in comparison to getting this same item at the store.Recommend it to anyone that is looking for savings all the way around on not just time but $$$.Regina,1
"Really unlocked, I just put in my sim card and activated using iTunes.",1
"This phone was advertised as being able to work with any GSM provider, but it turns out that it can only work with CDMA. So, I wasted $200 on a phone that didn't do what it was supposed to.",0
"I'm writing this review with the phone itself. I play games on my phone that would drain my old one, and I can play for about an hour and a half, and only lose about six percent. The size and speed of the phone is great for the price. This is easily a 200 dollar phone.",0
Nice phone in excellant condition. It looked brand new. It just wasnt a Verizon phone like the description on amazon said.,1
no its not meet my expectations i seem problems in this i donot think its original because i seems problem mobile charging and other thing i received fone today next when i will use it i can tell you more but i donot satisfied.Thanksand other thing last year we bought two htc one by amazon these two mobiles had all the fake axsesories inside the mobile we used only one week and after this we took for repair but couldnot repair .,1
Item as advertised delivered promptly and securely... 5 stars!!!,1
"Hi Amazon,I received the iPhone in good physical condition but there are some marks on it. However, the phone is deactivated and the screen says to connect it to a PC using iTunes. I tried to activate it through iTunes but was unsuccessful. The iPhone is not working. I hope you can help me so I can use the item I purchased.",0
This phone is great! It's a great price and it even has a good camera.,0
"If you want a phone with the original iOS, don't buy this one. It came with iOS 7.1.1, which is rather confusing since that OS came out more than 2 years after the phone did. When I questioned the seller about it, they said that it was updated by Apple before they liquidated the phone off to the seller.",0
I was somewhat disappointed with the product because it was refurbished. I expected it to be neater and to come with more accessories than just a charger.,0
Phone did not turn on at all. Was defective and I still had to pay to ship it back as well as pay for a restocking fee. Horrible,1
"I was unable to connect to 4G LTE with AT&T service even after spending hours in the store and speaking with tech support. I bought this phone to replace my beloved HTC M7, but it is clearly not as advertised.",0
"Used for several months, and it performed well, unlike big screen cellphone, this one could be stay for a long time without charging. highly recommend for buying a back-up phone",1
I bought the iphone 4s two months ago and no longer works so useless that is cheap if not hard so I'm very upset with my purchase,1
"Worked fine for 6 weeks but now screen is not displaying part of the top most left corner. Still functional, but annoying....",1
The phone is in excellent condition and it works perfectly fine.,0
"The phone functions as advertised, but there are issues with the volume on the earpiece. The package deal with all the extras made it a decent value. The reason I bought the phone was for the camera, and although it has a lot of megapixels, the lock time for pressing the button and taking a picture is very slow. Samsung has a better camera for quick shots.",0
"I got this phone for my daughter to use on straight talk. It was very easy to set up on a prepaid plan, and she loves it!",0
"Very Amazing Phone. I can't believe the phone was 32GB and Factory Unlicked and I paid less than a Brand New locked 8Gb phone. This is a much better deal and I returned the new iPhone I ordered previously, Thank You Very Much For This Amazing Deal I Love Amazon And Bayshine Inc.!!! :D heck ya!",1
"It's been a month since I got this phone and it's already malfunctioning, and I haven't even downloaded anything to it. I missed the return window by this point.",0
The phone has a problem with the earphone to listen to people when you call.,0
"I bought this iPhone from Ross Cellular, specifically for traveling overseas so I could substitute SIM cards in different countries. However, I had problems with it and took it into an Apple Store. They examined it and said the serial number had been changed as well as the components. I had to buy a REAL iphone from them. The warranty period was very short but I plan to discuss this with Amazon.com to see if anything can be done to refund my money. This seller is a",0
The phone is pretty good. The camera is brilliant. The only thing is that there are not many apps for Windows OS. The rest is awesome!,0
"The phone has a great design, but it gets quite hot when making phone calls.",0
I ordered two phones and one of the phones did not have an external sim port. Now i cannot return the phone which makes me feel sad.,1
I do not recommend this seller. The phone has problema since I bought it. When you make o receive calls the other person did not listen and now sometimes tve touch screen does not work well. I contact HTC and they told me the problem os the phone.,1
I like the product and the time in receiving it. Would recommend to my friends and others. Good to go.,1
DO NOT BUY THIS IPHONE !I've had it for two weeks and is a piece of junk:-The audio does not work most of the time (especially when using headphones).-It does not connect to Wi-Fi at times.-Safari app crashes constantly.-Battery runs out quickly once it reaches 50 %. Do not buy it. Be smart and buy a new one. I am returning this piece of junk.,1
This phone was unlocked. This is very embarrassing for Amazon.com to lie about their products. This is not the first time.,0
"After only two weeks of use, my phone developed a fault.",0
"The back screen on this phone was cracked, but I wasn't too worried about that because the phone was used. What I am worried about though, is that it only came with the charging cable and not the outlet part. Another thing is that the charger doesn't even work, so now I have to wait until tomorrow to get a new charger and hope that it was just the charger that was the problem and not the phone. Overall, not a great experience.",0
"The battery lasted for a few months, but then it stopped working and the phone turned off.",0
" Great phone, so glad I got one. So much you can do with this phone and the camera is super.",0
"The item arrived exactly as advertised. It was sealed in the original package and worked perfectly. The only issue was a small black spot on the screen, but this is a common and imperceptible defect of AMOLED screens. Overall, an excellent phone.",0
"The battery doesn't lasts. Wifi is not functional, I can't connect to a router. Only 3G/LTE.",1
"The phone is in really good cosmetic shape and the shipping was speedy, but what was not described was that the home button either does not function, or lags in response. We have had to download an icon app so that we can get to the home screen.",1
"If I could give this product zero stars, I would. I ordered the yellow one and I received the black one. I figured I could use this anyway because I didn't care much about the color. Then when I tried to turn the thing on, it was unresponsive. Even after charging it, nothing happened. I'm really disappointed.",0
Great 1st iPhone for my child! Easy to connect to my current carrier!,1
"Phone is good as expected, missing org box which was not mentioned.and best part its on latest iOS v",1
"Great product, despite being used, it is in very good condition both aesthetically and functionally. The phone is unlocked for everyone.!!",0
"Product of poor quality. I bought and brought me to use outside the USA, so it took me time to be able to test the device. To my surprise, the microphone did not work and all so the battery does not recharge properly. As I am not in the USA, I had to arrange myself the repairs to use the device which has cost me about US $ 60.00.Apple iPhone 4S 16GB Unlocked - White (Certified Refurbished)",1
"The item was listed as ""like new"", but there were some problems. First, the ear speaker's filter is missing. Second, camera's flash does not work. I cannot understand how they call this item as ""like new"". However, I received %40 discount after buying this item because of these problems.",1
"exactly as described, great condition, refurb phone...although it is unlocked the format stops it from being used with all carriers...",1
"Good afternoon, the phone is not a Lumia 990 Lumia 1020. There is a big difference between these two cellphones. The wireless charger is not working correctly.",0
"Nowhere does it state NOT TO REMOVE BATTERY. When I opened it, my battery just fell out--turns out, if it is removed, it won't even turn on. Piece of crap.",0
The iphone 4 was unlocked is a problem for me I had to take and spend more than they should excuse my English,1
"I bought this for my brother and he seems to be very happy with it. Even though it is an older version, it still serves its purpose well.",0
"Phone came in perfect condition, also came unlocked as promised(I'm writing this straight from the iPhone on straight talk) very satisfied.",1
We're one month into owning this product and we're very happy with it. It works perfectly and is used by a construction worker.,0
"I bought the phone because I liked the way it looked and the camera, and it worked fine. But I sold it because it doesn't work on my carrier in Venezuela (H+).",0
"It doesn't have a long battery life, you have to charge it daily.",1
"The item is exactly as described. I'm very satisfied. They even delivered on Christmas holidays, which surprised me. Full points to me!!!",0
"Faulty product. I was really excited about using this phone as a camera (since it packs a whopping 41mp, even though the sensor size is what's important). Unfortunately, the ""manual"" camera functions were damaged. White balance function was more of a yellow/ blue and ISO function was damaged. I do NOT like faulty products OR faulty SELLERS~",1
"My sons first smart phone and he loves it! The phone came in excellent condition. For the price and condition it's in, my wife and I consider the phone a steal!",1
I have purchased two. One worked well. The other kept freezing.,1
I love HTC phones its a good brand and its features are great. Its os is fast I have no problem so far,1
I'm paying over 400 for this iPhone which is fine but don't advertise that the phone is excellent condition if the home button is broken and the back glass seems like it was put in unprofessionally. The camera hole in the back is not align with the glass.,1
I expected to receive the key thingy to open the phone and insert my Sim card. Now I have to look it in order to make it work with my cell plan.,1
"The phone camera is very good and the OS is fast. However, it does not support LTE, only 4G.",0
"This phone would freeze up on me and was terribly slow. The reception was a very bad, too. This phone was running on 3g. I went back to my android phone.",1
Terrible - won't hold a charge. Refurbished nightmare - if we hadn't been in such a bind I never would have bought this,1
"I was concerned that the phone might be locked because it had the ATT logo, but I was relieved when the distributor quickly responded to my emails and clarified that it was unlocked. Now the phone works fine in Bangalore. So overall, it met my expectations.",0
I received the phone originally and it didn't work properly so I sent it back. They sent me the same phone with the battery taped up so it wouldn't malfunction.,0
This product is pretty good. I moved from a Lumia 920 to a 1020 and it wasn't a big hassle. :),0
"Received this item as described by the seller, so that I are completely satisfied.",1
"
Apple no longer supports the iPhone 6, and it cannot be updated to the latest iOS. Buyer beware.",0
"If you're in the market for an iPhone, you probably have made up your mind, and this is as good as they always are.",1
Do not purchase these phones! Both of them had touch screen issues within a few months and there is no warranty. The company will not take them back either.,0
"The new Lumia 1020 cellphones do not come with earphones or any other important accessories. The ""international version"" is simply an unlocked phone. This phone is full of garbage from AT&T and is missing important information.",0
"This product came with the original box and had already been programmed in a Asian language with somebody's profile and contacts on the phone. So it needed to be restarted to clear off the previous user's info. Also in the box was a ""type G"" to ""Type A"" adapter for the Nokia Charger. The screen is clear, and it is wrapped in cellophane nicely.",0
The charger isn't working. And the battery life is also not good.,1
"I bought this phone primarily for the camera, expecting that the 5x resolution would result in amazing photos. However, I was sorely disappointed - not only were the photos poor quality, but the phone itself was terrible. Save yourself the trouble and buy an Apple instead.",0
"Amazingly, the product works perfectly, I recommend it to everyone.",1
"I love my HTC One M7 Gold 32GB phone! It gets a lot of compliments because of its beautiful, rounded sides. It's so easy to use and it has great battery life. I'm really happy with this purchase.",0
Horrible. Guy scammed me. Could barely hear the person you were talking to.,1
"Looks like new, in addition to the HOME key is not sensitive. Good, service is also very good.Hope to continue",1
"This phone has a rare sound when sending and receiving messages, and when taking pictures. There is something damaged inside the phone.",0
"
It's like a new iPhone. The iPhone has no sign weariness, and it's working perfectly. Battery in good shape lasting for a day or two.",0
"I had to replace my lost iPhone 4s. As a frequent eBay customer, the amazon product is clearly superior. The quality is guaranteed to be like new and the price is much less expensive. I am considering buying another simply to sell it on eBay for the profit.",1
"I love the phone, but it had some trouble connecting to wifi. I had to take it to the store and get it fixed, which cost me extra money.",0
CAREFULL!I just bought one.It is not factory unlock.It is a T Mobile phone.It dosn't have HTC warranty.,1
I was a bit worried because the picture of the phone on the Amazon listing was not accurate. But the phone was exactly what I wanted and in perfect shape. It looked brand new and I got it for about the price of what it would cost to fix my old phone. I love the Nokia 1020 (except it does not accept SD cards) but I could not find another phone that I liked that was close to the 1020 in terms of features and price.,0
"Overall, I find Apple products to be very user-friendly and reasonably priced. I tried using my phone for almost 5 days and found that no matter what application I wanted to access, I had to connect my iPhone to my iTunes account! And of course, I had to give all my personal information like my address, email, phone number, and credit card number. It's absolutely ridiculous. Also, the features on this phone compared to Samsung's Galaxy phone are like comparing apples and oranges",0
"This phone is amazing for the price. My son broke his new zillion dollar samsung s4 or whatever. So, we got him a cool phone at at great (and maybe disposable) price.We will look to this shipper/store again if we need a phone.",1
"excellent phone, can compete with the best in its range if not for me is the best, really works like a charm, good camera, good screen, speed, only bad thing is the battery life",1
"Just one downside, the camera is terrible. The rest of the phone is as good as it can get for the price paid. Excellent phone",0
"I do not recommend this seller. I have had problems with the phone since I bought it. When you make or receive calls, the other person cannot hear you, and now sometimes the touch screen does not work well. I contacted HTC and they told me the problem is with the phone.",0
"Although the title says its a factory unlocked phone, it was actually an AT&T unlocked phone. Which means Android updates can only be done after AT&T rolls it out and not when HTC rolls them out.",1
"The connection with the charger is not good. This phone doesnt work with 4g/LTE. I feel cheated. The headphones are very low quality - the left and right channels are swapped, and the left is a lot louder than the right.",0
"My first review on Amazon. Pissed!!! Do not purchase this phone!!!! I bought it and I did not even get 4mths out of it!!! It's defective..... The phone overheats.... Barely picks up signal.... Battery drains often, does not keep charge. And now it won't come on at all. I need my money back!!!! No stars I would give it but I have to. Smfh",1
This product is garbage. The battery life is pathetic and the keyboard keeps freezing.,0
" No scratches or dents. No comments led me to believe that the camera would have the pinkish color if pictures taken in dark. Volume quality not so good. However, I do like the phone. It arrived on time.",0
"I bought a new iPhone online, and the camera has a white shadow on it. Every picture I take has the shadow.",0
This product seems to be brand new. I have no problems with the phone at all. There are no scratches or dents. I'm very happy with it.,0
"Good phone. I like the Outlook Sync. Camera is great.I received this unlocked phone. However, most of the settings included Malaysian, and got a doubt about warranty, and the seller said that this is international version, and no warranty! Well it is just a week for this $650 device. But, it is worrysome that there is no warranty.",1
This product was great and met all my expectations. I would definitely buy it again. 5 stars,0
I have had I phones 4s before and feel one of the best models Apple had made. This phone was in great shape while looking so slick. The seller had described the phone exactly the way it is and I'm very happy with my purchase,1
"The rear camera has a problem where pictures come out with a purple tone when used in an area with little lighting. I found that this is a factory problem with phones produced between March-June 2013. The one sold to me was produced in May 2013, I purchased it on Jan. 2015...I think if they were able to open it to unlock it, they should test the common problems before sending to buyer; I may return it...",1
I had to contact Amazon and get a refund and RMA because my phone's camera was defective.,0
I'm paying over 400 for this iPhone which is fine but don't advertise that the phone is excellent condition if the home button is broken and the back glass seems like it was put in unprofessionally. The camera hole in the back is not align with the glass.,1
My son loves this phone! I got it for him as a Christmas gift and he's very happy with it. It's still running strong! I love this phone!,0
Purchased the phone in February and it died today April 14. Exactly a month from its return window. Save your money!,1
"Was a little surprised when I got this to find out that it only takes the ""Big"" SIM cards and not the Micro or Nano. This was kind of a let down as not too many phones still use these large SIM cards and therefore would need to switch SIM cards if you already had active service with a GSM carrier.",1
"The delivery was timely and satisfactory. The Lumia 1020 phone is amazing, with the best picture and video quality ever to be installed in a mobile phone. It is simply the best.",0
The phone itself seemed fine. I wasn't able to tell if it was network-unlocked or not because the phone had an activation lock...definitely not something you expect from a certified refurbished phone.,1
Exactly as described. Phone in perfect condition and worked immediately with my ATT service.,1
i bought 2 of these. the phone was shown as unlocked. but it came as locked phone. the phone had scratches and one of them was poorly maintained.,1
"My HTC came in a brand new package with charger, USB, phone, manual book. The phone is brand new and I've been using it for over 3 weeks with no problems. Hardware and software are great, never froze on me yet. Planning to buy another one soon. Price is no complain and I have TMobile data text and internet everything is all functions.",0
The phone is defective and the power button and battery back are damaged.,0
"I like the phone but I have had problems with people not being able to hear me when I call them. That's frustrating because I prefer talking to people on the phone rather than texting. For example, if I'm going to be late for work, I can't just call and tell them. I have to text someone who is already at work and have them relay the message.",0
"Item as advertised, delivered promptly and securely. 5 stars!!!",0
The phone was a big disappointment because it couldn't work in loud speaker mode or when headphones were inserted. Shipping it back was a waste of money.,0
Not unlocked. It is still a Verizon phone. Once I got it up and running I loved it the moment it started working. had to spend extra money to have it switched over to straight talk.. company shipping is slow it took 35 days to get it to me.,0
"The seller promised me a discount for the trouble I went through, but only offered $10. I spent that much just sending the defective iPhone back to him. Where's my discount? He must have thought I was a fool twice. I may have to file a small claims court case to get a working iPhone plus a real discount.",0
Its says unlocked....but Sprint cannot bring it to their network,1
"I use the camera frequently, but it often crashes and requires a reset.",0
Yes...I'm truly 100% happy wit my iPhone. Great description and equipment testing.,1
Disappointed with this purchase the clips that hold sim card broke as soon as I attempted to put in my sim and I had to tape them in just to get it to work!!,1
"I love my new iphone, i arrived on time, nw i got all my apps onit. I can reach family and friend near or far",1
"After several weeks of using my son's phone, the home button stopped working. I told him to make sure everything was working, but the phone part is working.",0
"I gave it 5 stars because the camera is excellent. The software instructions could be improved, but that's not why I bought it.",0
"wasent happy with it at all. I could send and recieve phone calls ok , but no mobile data. my straight talk provider said it was not compatible with them and the verizon towers they go thru here in mid nebraska. that was the reason i bought a unlocked smart phone and it failed. that was the second unlocked smart phone i bought from you that did not work rite, not sure i want to continue buisness with you any more.",1
"I was not aware that this was an AT&T unlocked phone when I booked it. It is new, but a bit different from other regular HTCs. I did not get my software upgrade notification, and I am worried that even after spending the regular price, I did not get a regular new phone. :-(",0
"I am increasingly pleased with the Apple iPhone each day. It has amazing performance, stunning graphics, and is extremely functional. The camera is great, the touch-screen response is excellent, and there are thousands of useful and funny apps. The operating system is also excellent. Apple demonstrates why it is the market leader with this product.",0
"I was really happy with the quality of the iPhone I received - it was almost like new, and it came with its own otter box. Shipping was quick, too. So I'm very satisfied!",0
This phone is awesome. Great audio and display. Beautiful metal body. The battery life is good. It can last a whole day of moderate use on one charging. The only thing I didn't like was the homescreen. The panels displaying my facebook newsfeed are a bit superfluous.,1
The phone's OS kinda sucks and there is no new update. But the camera is good.,1
When I'm trying to start the mobile it's not coming up. Mobile is getting switched off,1
This phone is great! The pictures came out well and it arrived before I expected it.,0
Don't bother buying this phone. It broke after just a month of use. The screen started to fail and soon after it stopped working altogether. Save your money.,0
"This phone uses a lot of battery power at first, but after I downloaded the new OS software, I haven't had any more problems. The condition is as good as the vendor described. The HTC charger doesn't work, but luckily I have the same charger from my broken phone.",0
"Really unlocked, I just put in my sim card and activated using iTunes.",1
"The battery takes a long time to charge, and it's prone to breaking down. Your phone may shut down when the battery reaches 25%.",0
Bought this for my great grandson's birthday and it was in excellent condition. Also came with a case.,0
The item came on the sealed on the original package. New as it was advertised. Remember that the International Version won't work with 4G LTE Band 4. Check the supported bands for each model variant and that they are compatible with your own country's LTE network. The phone has a black spot but is a common and imperceptible defect of AMOLED screens. Excellent phone.Check the Lumia 1020 Model Variants 4G Specs: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_Lumia_1020#Model_variantsCheck your country LTE Network: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LTE_networks,1
This is not Nokia Lumia 1020... If you go in settings and click about phone you will see thst it is a different model number... what a rip off... FRAUD,1
"I bought the phone knowing that it was refurbished. I did not look new. The glass was possibly replaced but the sides of the phone were worn, possibly from a case it was in.The phone worked for about three weeks before it crashed. Would not charge, and would not turn on. I took it to Apple and they told me that the battery only lasts 3000 cycles and that it had not been replaced on the phone. It would cost $80. to replace it!This phone is junk and was not correctly refurbished. Save your self the trouble I had, and DO NOT BUY IT!",1
Item as advertised delivered promptly and securely... 5 stars!!!,1
"This phone is great value for the price, and the service is very fast!",0
My mom liked it. The only thing is that the phone is locked. It costs about a hundred dollars for my mom to unlock it in China.,1
"Iphone arrived in perfect condition, looks absolutely brand new. Battery life is great and it seems that the phone has never been used. We activated on Tracfone using their BYOP sim card and had no issues.",1
Seller was punctual and proactive with me about the product. The cellphone was great and an incredible deal.,0
"This phone has a lot of storage space for preteen selfies, but the camera isn't great.",0
"This phone is well made, and looks sharp, although it is a little bulky. I enjoyed the camera, and adjusted to the operating system (very easy to use), but a few software glitches as well as a lack of apps made me return mine.",1
"Looks great and is easy to use and update the software, but you have to be careful how you hold it or you attenuate the antenna and don't get much signal.",1
"This IPhone 4 is a great phone for anyone who needs a reliable phone with a great capacity. It may not be the latest model, but it is still a great phone and definitely worth the price.",0
I had the phone for 5 weeks and the phone stopped working! Too late to return or exchange it! Good way to get my money!,0
The phone is completely perfect. It accomplished everything I needed it to do and much more. Hopefully I can find a 5 [model] at a great price so I can upgrade.,0
The combination of Nokia and Windows Phone is a symphony. The only possible oponent could perhaps be iPhone 6.,1
A month after getting this phone the wifi just shut off and can not be turned back on...therefore anything I want to do on this phone has to run off my data plan.. It's terrible and I'm very unsatisfied with this product!!,1
"I love this phone! The only thing I wished it had were more apps....that is the ONLY thing missing. I recently had to purchase a new phone for this reason, but I kept my Nokia Lumia as my backup phone/emergency phone.",1
"The iphone 4 shipped quick and came with all accessories in the original packaging. The phone looked almost brand new but the home button did not always register. Ive heard that this issue is not that uncommon because lint and dust get trapped under the button. This was however a $315 phone listed as ""like new"" so I expected it to work flawlessly. This is my first amazon return but the process has been pretty easy so far.",1
"After purchase, the phone went crazy after 5 months with contacts getting lost. The phone got slow and the camera wasn't good.",0
I have bought two of these devices. One worked well while the other kept freezing.,0
"I'm returning this phone to Warehouse Deals, Inc. I saw that it said it was an ATT iPhone, but it's not. Be careful when buying from this company.",0
"I love the iPhone, the only thing because nw the Sim card is smaller,great devise I send it all the way to Jamaica and in the process of getting myself 1 ( Julie)",1
Battery dies too prematurely compared to my store-bought iPhone 4 yrs ago. And one of the audio speakers does not work - it arrived this way. Would not buy from this dealer again.,1
"The phone didn't have any scratches and looked like a brand new. The phone arrived nicely packed in the box with screen protector installed, charging cable, and an apple charger. The phone recognized the SIM card from the foreign provider without any problems.",1
"I was disappointed with this phone because it doesn't hold a charge very well. I had to go back to my old phone, which is much better.",0
"I broke my phone by taking out the SIM card and the battery fell out. I guess it's not supposed to come out, but since it did, the warranty was void. Don't waste your money on this phone.",0
"Touch screen doesn't work,its started a few months after bought.And has no calibration settings to fix it or even any means of fixing it on your own.:-(:-(:-(",1
"Great phone, the photos are amazing , its like having a good quality camera in your phone !",1
"If you're looking for a phone, I would recommend this place. The phone I got was in near perfect shape and it came with accessories. It works great.",0
"I received the product as expected. It arrived on time, and I am very happy with it. Great deal!",0
HTC is my favorite phone brand and this is a great phone!,0
This phone does not work and could not be sync with itunes....i need to return it. please help on how to go about returning it!,1
"This phone replaced an insane Nokia 920 that was a ""rebuilt"" phone. Best Nokia phone I have had yet.",1
This product is too fragile. The screen broke after the first drop.,0
"I had a bit of an issue at first, but the seller was very responsive. I had to connect the product to iTunes before using my new SIM card, but everything is in excellent condition now. I'm very happy with the product and will definitely do business with this seller again. Thumbs up!",0
Great purchase! It was as good as new... Screen was immaculate and had no surface scratched. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.,1
"The phone generally works well, but I had to disable a button that switches between screens because it was sticky and sometimes unresponsive. I was glad to see that the phone had this option, since it must be a common issue with older phones.",0
Just after the return window ended my phone ceased function! The speaker and microphone no longer work nor does the headphone jack. Very displeased!,1
"So far so good, I love my phone. I inserted a sim card from my cricket phone, got started without a problem or going to a carrier.",1
One of the two phones I received was defective. I'm very disappointed that a product this flawed could be sold on Amazon.,0
veryyyyyy slow Phone!! it keep freezing every 10min,1
"I bought a refurbished phone, but the screw that locks the screen down wasn't tightened. The screen fell off and cracked the day after I got it. I'm not very happy for the money that I spent. I should have just bought an upgraded phone.",0
This phone is great! The battery life is awesome and it's very affordable.,0
"Australian product code!! First off the phone is fantastic, get one. BUT the unit Amazon sent is flashed with an unlocked Australian/New Zealand product code. You wouldn't ever notice EXCEPT, Cortana is not released for this region yet. So while we have the 8.1 update, it did not enable Cortana. We can wait or go through a challenging ROM flashing to get it to the US.",1
"The phone is in great condition! It's a little slow, but that's probably because it's an older model iPhone.",0
"The battery life is an issue. The phone functions nicely, but it runs out of juice to fast to recommend.",1
"In less than 2 months, my phone got stuck on earphones mode. I must have used the earphones twice max. So one cannot hear anything unless an earphone is plugged in. Item can no longer be returned or exchanged. It's pathetic that a wanna be flagship phone has such cheap quality. I'll never buy Nokia or Microsoft again.",0
I love the phone and the delivery was timely. The phone arrived in great condition and I would definitely order again if I chose to upgrade.,0
I don't get my calls. My friends are not getting my textes. Phone takes a long time to start dailing if i am placing a call. No it is not the service because i went back to my old phone and it worked just fine.,1
This battery lasts a long time and offers great performance with no lagging. I'm extremely happy with my decision to buy this product.,0
"I've never had an iPhone before, but this one is great! The price is great and the customer service is fantastic. The phone arrived super fast and I'm loving it!",0
Crappy phone I will not buy anther certified refurbished cell phone.,1
Love it. It works like a charm. This product is highly recommended for anybody that is interested in it. Will buy again.,1
"I had a problem with my phone where it would get very hot when charging. I contacted customer service and they provided me with a return shipping label so I could send the phone back. I didn't have to pay for the return shipping, and I received a full refund for the phone.",0
Love the phone..only wish I had realized I have no way to add memory.Bit other then that I'm very pleased with the phone and happy with my experience with Amazon.,1
This device is great! The camera is amazing and I highly recommend it.,0
"Im very happy with my new mobil nokia. Now im learn to use it , it s fast, comfortable, easy to use applications.",1
ITS A VERY NICE PRODUCT... IT CAME AS I SPECTED‚Ä¶ I RECOMMENDED‚Ä¶ QUALITY 95%... WE ARE USING IT WITH NO TROUBLE AT ALL 100% OK‚Ä¶,1
Touch is so off. I can't even factory reset it to send it back.,1
This phone is perfect . Took a long time to get to me but when it arrived it was exactly what I ordered .,1
The product was in good condition and worked well when I traveled overseas.,0
I would not recommend this product. I got the phone and it was not even unlocked. I will never buy a phone on Amazon again.,0
It has moments wherein it suddenly stops in the middle of talking and turns off automatically. My communication with this one is constantly interrupted for no apparent reason.,0
This phone is the best. The camera is excellent and the phone is very responsive. It also has great performance. I highly recommend this seller.,0
"This is my second one, and is really frustrating because i have to take it too have everything copied. I can hear other people on line, but they can not hear me sometimes.",1
I bought 3 iphone 4s 16 gb ... 2 are works great ... but one of them doesnt charge well and the problem is not from the charger ... the problem from the phone entry slot . i deal with amazon and gave me 20 USD as a refund and im happy for it ... now I will fix my phone ... thanks,1
The phone is crap the battery hardly last 4 hours and the the phone just dies.,1
"I bought this as a present for my niece, and she was very happy with it. She's been using it for over seven months with no problems.",0
"This phone is excellent! It's small and comfortable, perfect for basic needs.",0
"I have had this phone for a while and it has failed me twice now. The screen came off and I was left with no way to contact anyone. I need to return this phone and choose a different one. If you could please contact me at 407 749 2975, I would appreciate it. Thank you.",0
"I initially wrote this phone off because the camera looked lame. But now that I've used it, I have to say that it's actually really great! The Nokia 925 is a good phone, but this one is even better. I don't mind the Windows phone format too much, since I'm an adult and don't really use my phone for gaming. I just use it for internet, light browsing, and navigation when I travel, and it does all of those things well.",0
phone needs to be powered off and on again every now and again,0
"This is an excellent seller that I highly recommend. They have great equipment and prices, and I couldn't recommend them more highly.",0
"The item was delivered on time, and I got what I paid for. I was looking for a white iPhone at a reasonable price, and I found one here. The color was different than what I wanted, but I was still satisfied with the product. I have had no bad experience so far.",0
"I needed a new phone to replace a ruined one and with all the features of my old phone. For the price, this phone is better with as many or more features than my last ""name"" phone had. And the price was right for a full-feature phone!!",1
This Phone is totally Awesome! you should BUY one and see for yourself!,1
it keeps updating and then everything get wipes even when you type in do not allow update it still does.,1
"RUN FROM THIS SELLER AND DONT LOOK BACK, I bought this I phone 32gb and when I got it headed to the ATT store to activate the phone. Long and behold it would not activate, the sim card would not read. I was told to go to the APPLE store to see if they can figure it out which I did. It turns out that it was NOT A 32 gb iphone but a 16gb, the phone was a damaged phone and should have never been sold. THIS SELLER IS A BAD BUSINESS PERSON. RUNNNNNNNNN",1
"Probably used, some buttons does not work. Overall very slow.This is not a new 4S",1
This iPhone arrived within 2 days in excellent condition. I was pleasantly surprised that there were no scratches or blemishes of any kind. The phone was immediately recognized by my carrier (T-Mobile) and synced perfectly with my iTunes account. This was an excellent purchase!,0
"The quality of the phone was better than expected, I was skeptical at first if it would be actually unlocked, but so far so good.",1
Great phone just need a option of ear bud pieces because not one fits all,1
the phone i purchased said it was carrier branded and comes in the original t mobile box...but instead an at&t phone arrived in an at@t box...this is some bs because my internet wont work,1
My iPhone 4S Unlocked was received on time and was packaged like a brand new phone. It was unlocked as advertised. I was able to activate it with my new SIM chip without any problems. It had to be setup like a new phone. We are very pleased and would recommend this phone.,1
"If you live in a country like Venezuela where security is an issue, this is the perfect phone for you! It's cheap and Simple to use, perfect for everyday tasks.",0
"This phone is great, but it's too small for my fingers. I had to send it back to Amazon.",0
"ikeaI would not trust Vantage Cellular because they advertise their phones as ""new"" when they are actually refurbished. I found this out after my phone died after only 7 months and Apple would not fix it because I was not the original owner.",0
This seller is excellent and the phone arrived in perfect condition and on time! Thank you!,0
I love this thing! It's so good that it makes me want to slap my mom with it!,0
"The phone looks good, but it has some glitches. Sometimes it will get stuck and won't return to the home screen, no matter what you do. You just have to wait a few minutes and it will eventually power down. The SIM card that was included was disabled and couldn't be used. At&t set me up with another one for free, but it took almost a week to arrive. I could have bought the same phone without a SIM card for nearly $15 less.",0
This phone was bought for a friend who is upgrading from an older model. He is very pleased with the phone overall.,0
Brand new phone and the home screen is hung. Tried restarting it but even then it does not work . Completely faulty piece,1
"I got the phone before the scheduled delivery date, and it was in the condition they described. But when I tried to set it up, it said it was stolen. I don't understand how someone could sell a stolen product. How could they not know?",0
"This phone is great for people who want a lot of features without having to spend a lot of money. It comes with a case and a screen protector, and the huge 4000mah battery means you can charge other phones with it using an otg cable. Plus, it comes in gold, and the 5.0mp front camera is perfect for taking selfies. It also has no problem running candy crush and other lower end games.",0
The phone was in perfect condition when I received it. I am very happy with my purchase.,0
"The phone looks good and works well, but the home button sometimes doesn't respond well to presses, which I don't like. Everything else works great, though. I'm still checking YouTube for tutorials on how to fix the home button issue. I hope that helps.",0
"Delivered on time, the phone performs well so far. However the only thing making me upset is the Window 8. Wish I didn't update. The phone worked excellent on previous platform",1
The phone arrived in the time stated when ordered. It was packaged in a bubble wrap inside of an appropriate sized box to prevent any damage to the phone. They also included a charger and headphones (not the apple brand). The phone was clean without even a scratch on it. It looked brand new. AT&T was able to immediately add a line to the phone. I am planning on purchasing my mother the same phone and will definitely return to this seller if they have a white one available as I am truly impressed.,1
"Rated 1 Star because the description said GREAT quality, not an iPhone with a broken home button that doesn't work unless I jam it down. Will have to take to the Apple store for a fix, and could not return it to Amazon because of time constraints. Annoying.",0
"I'm really happy with the phone - it came nicely wrapped in bubble wrap so it wouldn't bounce around, which was great. Thanks!",0
"Buy this cellphone as a gift for my wife, I like it because it is small and easy to use for her. The system uses the cellphone iphone is very stable.",1
"Overall the quality of the phone is amazing for the price. The screen is very Hd, everything is running smoothly. Would give it five stars but the screen protector it came with did not fit so that was disappointing.",1
We were very pleased with the condition of this phone when we finally received it. It looked brand new! We bought it for our daughter and she was very happy with it. Everything works well with no problems.,0
"I just ordered the iPhone 4, it is my first time, so I'm really nervous about it, I'm hoping that it does not come in with defects all over it. I really need it to be good cuz it's a present, just like I said before I really am hoping for the best. It's estimated to come on the 6th of December. So I'll let you guys know more about it once it comes in.",0
"I got a phone that was scratched on the side and had a replaced back case. It's a Verizon unlocked device, and it's worked quite well so far. It's not exactly new-looking or new-functioning, but I guess that's what you get with a refurbished phone.UPDATE: I've been using the phone for a month now, and it's just two days into my return window. The phone has started dying out on battery. I would recommend",0
This is a great phone which can still compete with today's newest windows phones but it can be a power hungry beast. In most cases this phone will not last a full day. You'll need a good thick micro usb wire or it keep dying while charging if it's not on a proper charging wire. This phone would of been perfect if it also included a micro sd slot especially for those who like taking high quality photos and videos.,1
"they arived in time in APO adress-Afghanistan its nice to buy used iphones when they are in good care,without problems,working perfect,recived as described",1
"The product was as described in terms of its appearance. However, the damaged keyboard made it impossible to log into WiFi or any of my associated accounts.",0
"The seller promised to send an unlocked iPhone but instead sent an AT&T locked phone with a broken screen. I had to spend more money to get the screen fixed, and now I am struggling to get the iPhone unlocked.",0
The product arrived with no blemishes. I activated it on Tracfone and the sound quality was excellent. I would highly recommend this seller. No complaints with the product.,1
Absoutley wonderful quick service no problems!!!,1
"I regret buying this iPhone from ""mobilekarma."" Not only was it sold to me as a blacklisted phone, I can't get it off the list. I contacted mobile karma and they don't have a way to settle or solve this issue.",0
This phone is perfect . Took a long time to get to me but when it arrived it was exactly what I ordered .,1
So far so good. Work well for the price. Holds charge for many days.,1
"This product looked almost new when I received it. There were barely visible scratches on the front and back, and it worked great. Thank you so much!",0
This phone is malfunctioning and won't connect to iTunes. I need to return it. Please advise on how to proceed with the return!,0
"Sometimes the audio on videos, music, and keyboard clicks is just loud static, and it won't turn down. It's not worth more than $100, if that.",0
"Ordered the White 1020, received a black 909, which was programmed in Chinese. Wow.",1
"phone is good work in Ukraine, but charge included for iphone 5! not compatible for this iphone 4s",1
"I sold my iPhone 4 32 GB because it had many malfunctions, like Sbakr and headsets. This product is not fit for the work he cheat. Dishonest seller!",0
"I loved my nokia phone, except after owning it for two months, it crashed and I cannot get it to power on. I've tried all the back ups, soft resets, and hard resets. It will not acknowledge a charge; therefore, it is DEAD:(",1
This phone cannot be used with any network unless it is unlocked. I purchased it now and have to pay to get it unlocked.,0
This is not a professionally refurbished item. People who have not checked this phone after repair may receive it in bad condition.,0
